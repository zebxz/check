Takes second to launch, light weight 
Virtual machines take longer to launch. They are heavy weight eg ngnix serevr 
** so any company you take containerization to it’s a big deal

In maven I renamed tesla to tisla

It is not  a good practice that when you want to access your application, you access them directly where endusers traffic goes directly to the application server.

Sow we are going to create a proxy ngnix server, so its going to be acting a sour frontend proxy such that end users cannot talk directly, they must go through webserver

Install ngnix
1)	We want to install ngnix to act as a proxy which implies that enduser traffic will be routed by the ngnix webserver so ngnix is acting as a load balancer, he receives the traffic from clients/endusers and route it to our backend application and our application will talk to our data bases
2)	We back up  the conf file by configuring the config file = sudo mv /etc/ngnix.conf  /etc/ngnix/ngnix
Vi /etc/ngnix/ngnix.conf    and copy our tomcat private ip into it. Therefor I have this for my backend server
19:45, in the backend, I have my ngnix server any traffic that comes it talks to the ngnix server and its route it to any of the tomcat servers

3)	We ensure the configuration is valid by executing;ngnix –t 
4)	Sudo ngnix –s reload but since I am already sudo ill run nginx –s 
5)	Sudo system ctl restart ngnix
6)	We check our browser if we can access ngnix server
It says 502 bad gateway, its because thers a security in linux called selinux which is enforced at this stage 
Setsebool  –P httpd
Therefore we will disable the security by running: can_netwrk_connect true

*********** we will be using other load balance like:
 ELSB: elastic load balancer

when we look at AWS web services we are going to study a very important concept called virtual private cloud where you will realise that in this architecture our frontend
load balancer will be in our public subnet while our application servers and databases will be running in the private subnet, so this is what is happening, ngnix is acting
as a load balancer


24:00
The Question is :
             HOW  DOES IT LOAD BAL OUR TRAFFIC 

The default option: t uses to bal traffic is called:
Round robin:  Request/traffic is distributed evenly accross the servers , with the

for you to explain in an interview that you have experience in ngnix webservers is also important
