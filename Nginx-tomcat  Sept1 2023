tried to setup ngnix but it says not suported

                                    WHAT IS CONTAINERIZED SERVVER 
Takes second to launch, light weight 
Virtual machines take longer to launch. They are heavy weight eg ngnix serevr 
** so any company you take containerization to it’s a big deal

In maven I renamed tesla to tisla

It is not  a good practice that when you want to access your application, you access them directly where endusers traffic goes directly to the application server.

Sow we are going to create a proxy ngnix server, so its going to be acting a sour frontend proxy such that end users cannot talk directly, they must go through webserver

Install ngnix
1)	We want to install ngnix to act as a proxy which implies that enduser traffic will be routed by the ngnix webserver so ngnix is acting as a load balancer, he receives the traffic from clients/endusers and route it to our backend application and our application will talk to our data bases
2)	We back up  the conf file by configuring the config file = sudo mv /etc/ngnix.conf  /etc/ngnix/ngnix
Vi /etc/ngnix/ngnix.conf    and copy our tomcat private ip into it. Therefor I have this for my backend server
19:45, in the backend, I have my ngnix server any traffic that comes it talks to the ngnix server and its route it to any of the tomcat servers

3)	We ensure the configuration is valid by executing;ngnix –t 
4)	Sudo ngnix –s reload but since I am already sudo ill run nginx –s 
5)	Sudo system ctl restart ngnix
6)	We check our browser if we can access ngnix server
It says 502 bad gateway, its because thers a security in linux called selinux which is enforced at this stage 
Setsebool  –P httpd
Therefore we will disable the security by running: can_netwrk_connect true

*********** we will be using other load balance like:
 ELSB: elastic load balancer


23:10
when we look at AWS web services we are going to study a very important concept called virtual private cloud where you will realise that in this architecture our frontend
load balancer will be in our public subnet while our application servers and databases will be running in the private subnet, so this is what is happening, ngnix is acting
as a load balancer


24:00
The Question is :
             HOW  DOES IT LOAD BAL OUR TRAFFIC 

The default option: t uses to bal traffic is called:
Round robin:  Request/traffic is distributed evenly accross the servers , with server weight taken into consideration, ngnix will be routing traffic to this backend servers 
depending on the load traffic will be distributed equally.



26:00
  OTHER METHODS INCLUDE

Least connections:  A request is sent to the server with the least no of active connectors , also server weight is considered
iP hash: eg, we can decide that Ip address from Africa let it go to appserver1, Ip address of America let it go to server2 etc
the server to which a request is sent is determined from the client IP address. eg it can decide that any address that has a specific octcts, that is it comes from a specific
destination should go to appserver one etc. thats is what is called ip hash.


                        
                                        HOW WE SUSTAIN THE MAINTENANCE PERIOD
26:59
if a server is down or undergoing maintenance/ upgrading it, vi the config file and write : "down" beside the server ip address
Also for the server we want to allocate more traffic we will write "weight =4", 
eg
we have 5m requests/users, we can assign  1m to the other server with 8GB  and 4M to that server with 64GB, ie 4x the number of users

load balancers helps to 
load balancers
                                                                    users >>> LB >>>> APP >>>> DB
security: Acts like a layer of security ie if anyone is trying to hack into our app it can be stopped at this stage which is very important 

health check: if its routing traffic/load balancing to about 30servers it ensures that it does not route traffic to a server that is not healthy, so it runs health check in 
the backend

IQ       WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TYPE  app.com or google.com    (domain name service)
54:30
  once you type google.com it going to query global DNS searching for the webservers that are associated to this hostname and once it locates the server, immediately traffic
will be routed to that server


for example, why you type www.landmark.org, what happens is that in the backend you are going to query global DNS(global Domain name service) and there is a command is the 
backend called NS look up, it is going to be searching for the server.

53:15
eg    if i run nslookup www.landmark.org shows the address of our ngnix webserver

                                                
                                          WHAT CAN MAKE A SERVER UNHEALTHY/ TO FAIL
56:00

1) There could be a spike in the CPM, lets assume that a lot of processes are running in the server or the server is receiving a lot of traffic, it may not be haelthy to 
recieve additional traffic . and thats one of the reason that can make a server to be unhealthy

2)if for some reason the java process is not running in the tomact server, if java is not running, tomcat not to start, if you deploy appl you cant access it so if java 
process fail, it can make a server to be unhealthy and as such the webserver will not route to an unhealthy traffic thats why ngnix is important for load balancing because 
it has all this advantages






















39:44
for you to explain in an interview that you have experience in ngnix webservers is also important
