WE CANT CREATE CONTAINERS WITH THE SAME NAME:
    ####### The above file wants to create a container with the name nodeapp but it couldnt deploy bc earlier, we had created a container with the name nodeapp ,, therefore 
we need change the name of the new container we are trying to create 
after changing it ... SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED..
