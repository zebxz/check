he said der was ngnix in the k814 video on probes but i dnt think so 
helm   
nginx-ingress1


frm an infrastructure point of view u realise that we can access our appl using multiple services ,,, if u were going to access ur appl uisng a lbalancer service that wil
incur additional cost bc a lbalancer wil create a new lbalancer in aws

5:37
we can discover our appl using  a service and all service act as lbalancer, for internal comm we can use cl8 ip service, trafic wil be routed accordingly the service perfoms
dns resolution for my appl ... for external traffic our service type wil be nodeport, it can attract external traffic, and as part of nodeport service like for a mg8 cl8
what else can we create? we can create loadbalancer(this a lbalancer service)... bt generally cl8ip is for cmmu within the cl8, whereas nodeport n lbalncer is gud for 
external comm

frm an infrastructure point of view we can place our lb in the public subnet n our node in private subnet, for (one appl to com to the other, it nids to go tru the service of 
the appl) evrytin is runin in aws, lb is nt free , they are xpensive (for us to be able to keep our cost at the barest minimun we can deploy nginx ingress,we can create a new
service in the cl8 called ngnix ingress

when we create ngnix service for our appl we can now hv service of type cl8 ip service, that way all the service in the cl8 wil be a cl8 ip type for the appl to recive 
external traffic we wil deploy an nginx ingress controller inside the cl8, on a node we can do a dployment called ngnix ingress so the pod is scheduled wil mg8 hw traffic is 
routed to our backend appl, so as part of the deployment we are also creating a service for ngnix ingress controler
