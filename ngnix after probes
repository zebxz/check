he said der was ngnix in the k814 video on probes but i dnt think so 
helm   
nginx-ingress1


frm an infrastructure point of view u realise that we can access our appl using multiple services ,,, if u were going to access ur appl uisng a lbalancer service that wil
incur additional cost bc a lbalancer wil create a new lbalancer in aws

5:37
we can discover our appl using  a service and all service act as lbalancer, for internal comm we can use cl8 ip service, trafic wil be routed accordingly the service perfoms
dns resolution for my appl ... for external traffic our service type wil be nodeport, it can attract external traffic, and as part of nodeport service like for a mg8 cl8
what else can we create? we can create loadbalancer(this a lbalancer service)... bt generally cl8ip is for cmmu within the cl8, whereas nodeport n lbalncer is gud for 
external comm

frm an infrastructure point of view we can place our lb in the public subnet n our node in private subnet, for (one appl to com to the other, it nids to go tru the service of 
the appl) evrytin is runin in aws, lb is nt free , they are xpensive (for us to be able to keep our cost at the barest minimun we can deploy nginx ingress,we can create a new
service in the cl8 called ngnix ingress

when we create ngnix service for our appl we can now hv service of type cl8 ip service, that way all the service in the cl8 wil be a cl8 ip type for the appl to recive 
external traffic we wil deploy an nginx ingress controller inside the cl8, on a node we can do a dployment called ngnix ingress so the pod is scheduled wil mg8 hw traffic is 
routed to our backend appl, so as part of the deployment we are also creating a service (ingressSVC )for ngnix ingress controler and the service will act as our frontend n 
based on this service  we aer goin to create some ingress rules wich will state hw traffic can be routed, we say smt like  e.g if somebody type myland.net it wil route
traffic to a particualr service, hellomyland.net these ar ingres rules, we create ingress rules like this,we v an ingress controller pod such that if an endusers try to acess
our appl tru the appl service thye can type any of the alias we cretaed in the rule (these are Arecord wich v been created) n once that happens the traffic comes into the cl8
the ingres service is a lbalncer service n as traffic is routed, it comes into the cl8 n its goin to be manged by the ingress lbalancer service whih wil immediately talk with
the ngnix ingress controler pod bc the ingrss service is what is used to mg8 trafic into our ngnix ingress controller pod, the pod is workin with ingress rule, it identifies
that the trafic dat was typed by users( helomyland.net) has a backend wich is the service (heloSVC) of the appl (hello pod) , therfore once it gets into the cl8 the ingress
controller wil route traffic to the helloSVC then to the hello pod.
so with the use ngnix ingress we can route traffic to multiple backend appl, so ngnix ingres is deploying to us a layer 7 lbalancer.
what will happen to the ngnix ingress CONTROLLER POD:
we are deploying the nginx ingress controler pod , it is deployed using the controler manger e.g deployment, deployemnt is used to ensure that the pod is up n running, if the
replica goes down it is recreated, so inside the cl8 an ingress rule is created.
20:10
the ingress service cannot route trafic directly ot the hellopod bc  the ingres service only comm with the ingres conttroller pod 



******************************************  DEPLOYING NGNIX  INGRESS in our CL8   >>>>>>>>>>> 21:006
nninx ingress can be easily deployed 
IF YOU HAVE :
 a kops cluster , that will be deployed seamlessly 


he goes to github

nginx-ingress contoller:    ( more info on ingress and steps  to setup ngnix in the link below) evrythin was deployed frm the github account

users > ingresSVC lb , it acts as d frontend therfore it provides additional layer of scurity n with it we can route traffic to multiple lb ie d diff app services:>  e.g
        bc its a layer 7LBalancer.                                                                                                                ingress rules
                                                                                                                                               helloSVC: hello.myland.net7
                                                                                                                                               appSVC:app.mylandtech.net8
                                                                            26:50                                                                   webSVC: web.mylandtech.net9
                                                                            each of theses service hv their own endpoint e.g 7,8,9, 
                                                                                       the endpoint is the number of pod replicas that are deployed
                                                        we ar routing traffic to our backendappl using cluaterip  and btw clusterip n NOdeport, cluserip is the most secured
         service in k8 bc it doe nt accept traffic outside the cl8, our cluster is vulnerable when it accepts external comm, external com is likely to mk our cl8 vulnerable
       therfore clusterip increases our cl8 security, so introducing ngnix ingress, it hepls us to use a highly secured k8 discovry type which is clusterip.

~######### in the ubuntu server
kubectl get all
we can see deployments done with loadbalancer service type
now we wnt to use ngnix ingress and as such we dnt need loadbalancer service type again bc it wil be wastage of resources 
so we can run kubectl edit svc springapp                                                           and when we checked in aws console the lb has been deleted
now inside the manifest file change the service type to ngnix                           ####### he tried it and it worked , lb to cluster   32: 20
also if our service type was cllusterip, we can change it to loadbalancer or nodeport but if it was loadbalancer we cant change it to clusterip
we can also change from nodeport to loadbalancer
######## #############  to change service type we can also vi into the manifest file that we deployed 


********we are deploying the ngnix ingress controller using some yml file in the github account  .... ...........  34:47
  1) clone
    cd 
2) namespace : the service account is for k8 security
3)RBAC
4) CREATE daemon set, we can deploy using a daemonset, k8 will cread a daemon controller on evry node or a deploy it using deployment , 
so he ls and we saw: 
common daemon-set deployment service
if we wnat to use deployment, we just wnt to create a single pod:  kubectl apply -f deployment
deployment.apps/nginx-ingress created
5) check if the ngnix pod is running with the command
when we run kubectl get po, we dnt see the pod bc its running on a specific namespce so we hv to specify the namespace
kubectl get po -n nginx-ingress
6)create loadbalancer service
$ kubectl apply -f service/loadbalancer-aws-elb.yaml
kubectl get svc -n nginx-ingress

43:20 
bc we hv nginx controller deployed, our service type will be clusterip
he did a deployment using deployment as our choice k8 object, he said we can also use replica set but deployment is our choice k8 object
kubectl appl -f jp.yml
but it failed
he realised thers was a resource quota he created in previous class 
kubectl get resourcequota
kubectl delete resourcequota test-ns-quota
kubectl appl -f jp.yml
created
kubectl get deploy and we can see the pods running as desired
############ 47:50
creating a service
bc we hv nginx controller whic is a k8 operator or what we call a k8 plugin or an add on that enhances the function an dthe security of k8,  so with it we are sure that 
our cl8 wil be more secured so we cna take advantege of such a secured parameter 
the type of service we will create is  clusterip and as such i can decide to write it or not and ther shud be no port ip and no NopePort number as wud hv been d csae if 
it was NodePort service

kubectl get svc 
we can see all our service are of type clusterIP and its more secured service discovery option
kubectl get po --show-labels 
we can see our pods and their labels


55:36
############ CREATING INGRESS RULE  ...........  continuing with our ingress installation script
7) we can use hostbased routing or path based routing

in aws  we see a LBalancer was deployed in uS West1, where our eks cluster is running     .....  .......  56:10
since i hv this lb, i wil go to the dns service, aws route53, 
creating record set , A record
its an alias to an appl lb
if u type this, its routed to .....> this service
springapp.mylandmarktech.net ... >  springapp
web.mylandmarktech.net   .........> webappsvc
hello.mylnadmark .........> hellosvc

.........now we will create an ingress rule to achieve this
vi ingress-resource.yml
***************** created using hostbased routing

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: apps-ingress-rule
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: springapp.mylandmarktech.net
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/"           ****this is the root path, http
        backend:
          service:
            name: springapp
            port:
              number: 80
  - host: hello.mylandmarktech.net
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/"               ****this is the root path, http
        backend:
          service:
            name: hostsvc 
            port:
              number: 80
  - host: web.mylandmarktech.net
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/java-web-app"             *******dnt knw why we are using this  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????
        backend:
          service:
            name: webappsvc
            port:
              number: 80


before wwe deploy this lets run
kubectl get ingress
none
kubectl apply -f ingress-resource.yml
ingress ruke created
and wwe hvae this ingress here
lets describe the ingress , its called app ingress  rule
kubectl describe ingress apps-ingress-rule
we can see the host and the backend app its routing traffic to 
host                                     path backends                the backendpoints
springapp.mylandmarktech.net              /   springapp:80 )10.10.0.122:8080,10.10.1.148:8080,10.10.1.235:8080)
                                                    this springapp service has 3 endpoints
hello.mylandmarktech.net
web.mylandmarktech.net

************* so if we wnat to access this application, lets find out if evrytin has been deployed as expected

we type this in google and we can access the database
springapp.mylandmarktech.net
hello.mylandmarktech.net/java-web-app         ??????????? i dnt knw why this has a java-web-app path

we see that ingress is working
so with the help of ingres we are able to access our appl and we are able to use the most secured service discovery option in k8 which is clusterip service

******* ********** ******** we hv deployed using host based routing
we can also deploy using path based routingand in this case we will just have one hostname with diff path like 
while creating ingress
vi ingress2.yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress2              ***i can enter a namespace if i want bt am nt entering any name space for now
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: mylandmarktech.net           ******lets assume this is my host
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/"           ****this is the root path,  cud be linking me to helloservice
        backend:
          service:
            name: hellosvc
            port:
              number: 80
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/java-web-app"               
        backend:
          service:
            name: webappsvc 
            port:
              number: 80

**********this ingress2 is routing traffic to 2backned service but it can alos route traffic to more 
lets add one more 

- pathType: Prefix
        path: "/tesla"               *we hv an appl /taela   
        backend:
          service:
            name: teslasvc            so this routing trffic to my tesla app
            port:                         lets jst add this even though we dnt hv the service yet
              number: 80


deploying
kubectl apply -f ingress-resource.yml

lets describe ingress
kubectl  get ingres
NAME                      CLASS             HOSTS
DDRESS       PORTS         AGE                                                     **********this is host base routing so it has multiple hostooooooooooo 
apps-ingress-rule          nginx             springapp.mylanmarktech.net,hello.myland,arktech.net,web.mylandmarktech.net      
              80          10m
ingress2                  nginx               mylandmarktech.net             **********we hv jst one host bc its path based routing 
             80            23s

1:18:00
************ if we type mylandmarktech.net in google we dnt get any response bc we hv nt created the record set to establaish the response
in aws we are using a dns service which is route53, in route53 w ehv to create A record set wherewe will state that my landmark tech is being forwarded to the loadbalancer
so lets go bk to aws and create the record set

502 error is server error , 502 error its called server site
