    LINUX FILE STRUCTURE

                       LINUX COMMANDS
WhAt can be done on my server after accessing it 

1)file management in linux, we have to look at the file structure, the nomeclature, how it is being named 
file mgt releted tasks:
How are files Called in linux        
Windows                                            linux/mac
files                                                files
folder /foldes                                   directory/directories (container of files)
Sub-folders                                           sub - directories
  

GO to windows and click my pc - C ;\
root dIRECTORY: the root directory created when you launch a windows system it starts from C:\
ROOT DIR for linux is - forward /               ( / this is root dir, its root env owned by root  , cd /, trying to get into root user

the root directory [/] is the main principal dir where other directories and sub-directories are created from 

Linux started around 1991 by linus torlvads
linuz is a mulri-user, multi tasking operating system
unlike IBM AIX, sun solaris, HP-ux ..
linux is "case sensitive" IS is different of LS.LIST 

FOLLOWING ARE THE LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS :
1) Redhat linux
2) Centos linux
3) Ubuntu linux
4) Suse linux
5) Fedora linux
6) Gentoo linux
7) mandriva linux
8) Debian linux
9) slackware
10) Amazon linux 2AMI 
11) faule - linux, landmark linux




sudo - to create a new user
Ls -a = list directory content with files and & dir 
starting with . ie including files 
                                                           ls/filename1/file inside file1 
commands : ls dir name  = list the content of your pwd eg ls /home/ec2-user
ls = list the content of a directory 
pwd = present working directory
hostname = serverName
cd = change directory
commands to change hostname : sudo hostnamectl set-hostname demo
sudo su - ec2-user

sudo su - user = to switch user

root directory 
[root -user@demo ~ ] ls /
bin home media  root sys
boot lib mnt run tmp
dev lib64 opt sbin usr
etc local proc  siv var

home; contains users' home directory details 
home contains user home directory information eg
ec2-user [a user created by the system}
domi(sudo add user domi) 
obi (sudo adduser obi) 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo adduser obi
[ec2-user@demo~] $
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls/home 
ec2-user obi


bin contains binary files (commands)
cat fileName: used to read the content of a file
ls, pwd, clear, cd, touch (to create a new file)    eg  touch test.txt
cat -n filename

i just did adduser paul and paul was created

we also hv system binary files ,can only be executed by user with admin priviledges ,the admin-user/or the root user/administrator 
sbin: contains system binary files/commands
eg of system binary files : 
adduser, to add user
passwd, : can be used to assign passwd to users
chage, used to modify users expiry date 
chown  change own 

we aslo hv the etc dir 
also var dir 

****** administrator is called root user

************************************  in performing task in linux, there are diff category of users

                             INTERVIEW QUESTION
What is the diff btw bin and sbin directory in linux ??
SBIN: are binary files only executable by users with adminstrative or elevated priviledges or admin/root user
eg adduser , chage

                              WHILE
BIN : Binary fies executable by any user (normal user& admin user)
eg ls, pwd, cd, touch

          ###########what is configuration file ??


we can cat to check the content of etc/shadow ie info abt the passwd of user
[root@demo~] # cat/etc/shadow 

etc : contains configuration files
/etc/shadow = detail information about users passwd
/etc/passwd = detail inf abt users                         ****** contains file of all users
/etc/ssh/sshd_config = ssh configuration details
   ssh=secure shell
sshd = ssh service/ daemon = user Name/passwd    eg to access your server via ssh you need username/passwd OR username & ssh key
UserName/ssh -private-key

- tmp: temporal files
-opt: directory where softwares & packages should be installed, it is the best place to install 
- var: var directory contains dynamic files
eg /var/logs/messages
********* to check 
[root@demo~] # ls var
account empty lib mail run adm ftp local nis spool cache games lock opt
tmp db kerberos log preserve yp

[root@demo~] # ls/var/log
README dnfrpm.log hawkey.log journal lastlog private chrony cloud-inst.log
amazon btmp audit sa sssd tallylog wtmp dnf.log

-pro directory: Contains inf about the hardware (hardware info)
eg mem info - memory information
cpu info  - cpu information
ï¼»root@demo-# cat/proc/meminfo = to check for info about my memory
[root@demo~# Cat/proc/cpu info
