                       LINUX COMMANDS
WhAt can be done on my server after accessing it 

1)file management in linux, we have to look at the file structure, the nomeclature, how it is being named 
file mgt releted tasks:

How are files Called in linux        
Windows                                            linux/mac
files                                                files
folder /foldes                                   directory/directories (container of files)
Sub-folders                                           sub - directories
  

GO to windows and click my pc - C ;\
root dIRECTORY: the root directory created when you launch a windows system it starts from C:\
ROOT DIR for linux is - forward /               ( / this is root dir, its root env owned by root  , cd /, trying to get into root user

the root directory [/] is the main principal dir where other directories and sub-directories are created from 

10:53******* For us to understand file mgt, , we have to look at the file structure, the nomeclature, how it is being named 

Linux started around 1991 by linus torlvads
linuz is a mulri-user, multi tasking operating system
unlike IBM AIX, sun solaris, HP-ux ..
linux is "case sensitive" IS is different of LS.LIST 

FOLLOWING ARE THE LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS :
1) Redhat linux
2) Centos linux
3) Ubuntu linux
4) Suse linux
5) Fedora linux
6) Gentoo linux
7) mandriva linux
8) Debian linux
9) slackware
10) Amazon linux 2AMI 
11) faule - linux, landmark linux



COMMANDS:
sudo - to create a new user
Ls -a = list directory content with files and & dir 
starting with . ie including (hidden)files   ********* i added this hidded when i was making the summarized notes
                                                           
commands : ls dir name =  eg ls pwd                                          ls/filename1/file inside file1
ls = list the content of a directory = list the content of your pwd eg ls OR ls /home/ec2-user  ... BC /home/ec2user is my pwd
pwd = present working directory
hostname = serverName
cd = change directory
commands to change hostname : sudo hostnamectl set-hostname demo
                                sudo su - ec2-user
sudo su - user = to switch user


root directory 
[root -user@demo ~ ] ls       ***** checking for files in the home dir
[root -user@demo ~ ]............ we get  nothing bc we dnt hv any files (yet)in the home dir, i added yet while makin summary note
[root -user@demo ~ ] ls /      ie to list the content of the root dir
bin home media  root sys
boot lib mnt run tmp
dev lib64 opt sbin usr
etc local proc  siv var

                                            HOME; contains users' home directory details 
home contains user home directory information eg
when we check
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls/home 
ec2-user
ec2-user [a user created by the system}
lets add user domi(sudo add user domi) 
lets add user obi (sudo adduser obi) 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo adduser obi
[ec2-user@demo~] $
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls/home 
ec2-user domi obi


bin contains binary files (commands)
cat fileName: used to read the content of a file
ls, pwd, clear, cd, touch (to create a new file)    eg  touch test.txt
cat -n filename
******30:18
i just did adduser paul and paul was created

                                              SBIN 
we also hv system binary files ,can only be executed by user with admin priviledges ,the admin-user/or the root user/administrator 
sbin: contains system binary files/commands
eg of system binary files : 
adduser, to add user
passwd, : can be used to assign passwd to users
chage, used to modify users expiry date 
chown  change own 

we aslo hv the etc dir 
also var dir 

****** administrator is called root user

************************************  in performing task in linux, there are diff category of users



26:00/30.35
                             INTERVIEW QUESTION
What is the diff btw bin and sbin directory in linux ??
SBIN: are system binary files only executable by users with adminstrative or elevated priviledges or admin/root user
eg adduser , chage

                              WHILE
BIN : Binary fies executable by any user (normal user& admin user)
eg ls, pwd, cd, touch

****33;50
          ###########what is configuration file ??
  configuration files (commonly known simply as config files) are files used to configure the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs or applications, 
server processes and operating system settings.


we can cat to check the content of etc/shadow ie info abt the passwd of user
[root@demo~] # cat/etc/shadow 

etc : contains configuration files
/etc/shadow = detail information about users passwd
/etc/passwd = detail inf abt users                         ****** contains file of all users
/etc/ssh/sshd_config = ssh configuration details
   ssh=secure shell
sshd = ssh service/ daemon = user Name/passwd    eg to access your server via ssh you need username/passwd OR username & ssh key
UserName/ssh -private-key

****38:35
- tmp: temporal files
-opt: directory where softwares & packages should be installed, it is the best place to install 
- var: var directory contains dynamic files
eg /var/logs/messages
********* to check 
[root@demo~] # ls var
account empty lib mail run adm ftp local nis spool cache games lock opt
tmp db kerberos log preserve yp

[root@demo~] # ls/var/log
README dnfrpm.log hawkey.log journal lastlog private chrony cloud-inst.log
amazon btmp audit sa sssd tallylog wtmp dnf.log

-pro directory: Contains inf about the hardware (hardware info)
eg mem info - memory information
cpu info  - cpu information
ï¼»root@demo-# cat/proc/meminfo = to check for info about my memory
[root@demo~# Cat/proc/cpu info

                                               LINUX BASIC COMMANDS (basic linux commands)
performimg tasks in linux systems uisng the (CLI) command line interface
A directory is a container of files and sub-directories (directory commands)
A folder is a container of files


*****42:58
                               FILE MGT
             DIRECTORY MGT COMMANDS
mkdir = create a directory or directories
rmdir = delete an empty dir
rm -rf = delete my dir
cd =  directory navigation
pwd = present working dir
ls = list of the dir content
tree = show me both parent and child dir

47:20
TICKET001:
Create work directories for telsa client
[ec2-user@demo~] $  mkdir tesla

to check if the directory was created 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls
telsa (test.txt)       , our proof

*****47:58
TICKET002:      create directory (mkdir)
create project 01  directory using the format below 
dev/git/maven/aws        nexus/java

it means that we want to create a dir called dev, inside dev there will be git, inside ther will be maven, inside amven aws nexus

the command to use is  = mkdir -p  dev/git/maven/aws
we can also  = mkdir -p-v dev/git/maven/aws
   OR -pv
-p = create including the parent directory 
-v = create in verbose mode (its a system informing what has happened

******51:40 ... mkdir class33 and mkdir -v class33 , are 2 diff commands
when we create in verbose mode, the system informs you what has happened as seen below 
****52:10
eg mkdir -v class33
[ec2-user@demo~] $ 
[ec2-user@demo~] $  mkdir -v class33
mkdir; created directory class33


**** now we wil create our tcicket002 in verbose mode

[ec2-user@demo~] $ mkdir -pv  dev/git/maven/aws
mkdir: created directory 'dev' ie directory dev created 
mkdir: created directory 'dev/git' ie directory git which is inside dev created
mkdir: created directory 'dev/git/maven ie directory maven which is inside git and dev created
mkdir : created directory  'dev/git/maven/aws


******** with commands automation is very possible, so we are taking advantage of automation


53:27
BUT HOW ELSE CAN WE CARRY OUT THIS TASK IF WE DNT USE COMMANDS 

  HOW TO RUN TASK IN LINUX SYSTEMS
-GUI/console 
- CLI = commands with some automation
- script with more automation


TO CONFIRM THE DIREECTORIES WERE FORMED
[ec2-user@demo~] $  Ls dev
git
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls dev/git
maven
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls dev/git/maven/
aws
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls dev/git/maven/aws
[ec2-user@demo~] $ .... nothing is in aws


56:21
***** but which command can i run that can show me all my dir, both the parent and child
thers a command called the tree command 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ tree
bash tree :command not found
but when i execute the tree command, it says command not found
once its nt found, we can install the command


       TO INSTALL A COMMAND NOT FOUND 

we can install the command using a package manger
sudo is a command that permit admin to run commands as another user .. 58.50
install tree  ....  *** this is an admin task

59:30
******** remember that ther are some users that we craeted, let me try paul
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo -u paul yum install tree
acces denied bc hes nt a root user
this comman can only be run wit super user priviledge, only the root user on most systems
********* lets change it now to root user
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo -u root yum install tree  .... **** bc ec2user is a root user that was created by the system
successful

******1:01;03
as a root user, u can either run
******** to install tree using root command/priviledges
sudo yum install tree  
OR
sudo -u root yum install tree
both commands means that you are assuming the root user position
but the first is preferred bc you are typing less

#######
su -root - switch user to root ( it requests for root user password )& if u dnt hv the passwd, u cant switch user to become root
sudo -i switch user to root without password
sudo -u-

**** when you switch to oot user  eg
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo -i
[root@demo~] $ 
[root@demo~] $  yum install tree    ... bc i am now root user so no need for sudo



########
the most secure option to run this will  not be to switch user to root but to run the command under the ec2-user while assuming root priviledges.


1:05
[root@demo~] # exit
logout
[ec2-user@demo~] $ 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ who am i
ec2-user
[ec2-user@demo~] $ 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo -i
[root@demo~] #
[root@demo~] # exit
logout 
[ec2-user@demo~] $

******
ec2user has some some sudo right so he can run this task assuming  sudo priveledges
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo yum install tree

[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo tree
 now wee see the files in a very nice directory strutcure ....  *1:06:40



APPLY THE COMMANDS: 

cd = change/leave 
cd ../    navigate one directory backward
cd -      ( forward)  navigate to your last working directory

************* cd = to navigate the user home directory 
cd.. = to navigate one directory backward
cd../../../../ = navigate 4 directories backward



[ec2-user@demo~] $ pwd
homw/ec2-user
[ec2-user@demo~] $ cd dev
ec2-user@demo dev
[ec2-user@demo~ dev] $ ls 
git
[ec2-user@demo~dev] $ cd git 
ec2-user@demo~git $ 
ec2-user@demo~git $ cd maven
ec2-user@demo~maven $ 
ec2-user@demo~maven $ ls
aws
ec2-user@demo~maven $ cd aws
ec2-user@demo~aws $ 
ec2-user@demo~aws $ pwd 
ec2-user dev/git/maven/aws
ec2-user@demo~aws $ cd../                backward to maven frm aws
ec2-user@demo~maven $ 
ec2-user@demo~maven $ cd../               frm maven to git
ec2-user@demo~git$ 
ec2-user@demo~git $ cd -                      forward, frm git to maven
ec2-user@demo~maven$ 
ec2-user@demo~maven $ cd../../                2steps backward move to dev
ec2-user@demo~dev$ 
ec2-user@demo~dev $ cd -            forward, from dev to maven
home/ec2-user/dev/git/maven
ec2-user@demo~maven $ cd../../../           from maven to ec2-user home
ec2-user@demo~ $       ie 3 steps backwards



                    COMMANDS TO DELETE DIRECTORIES
rmdir dirName = deletes empty directory/directories
directory with content cannot be deleted by rmdir only empty dir can be deleted

******* to delete directory with content
rm -rf dirName = deletes any directories with or without content

              




ctrl C = to kill a process
exit = logout/exit rootuser
exit = logout a session
