HW SECURITY IS MANAGED... level of security
ist person is authorized to creats server
2nd person to perform task on the servers

25:34:00 i v a server hosted in aws, inside the aws account at the global level i v some users, all iam users ,,, in the same account i v created my ntw so now i 
v my vpc in the vpc i aslo created subnetwrks, in aws we can create resource and to be able to create resources, u v to be authorized like creating an instance.. that
way not evryone can ,, creating the infastruture itself, u v to be authorized to crate or provisoin the server,, anoda person can be assigned permission to carry 
out task on the server , now he can try to ssh  in to the server so to get access theres firewall so i hv to open port22,, b4 it is routed , inside my vpc v been able
to create route tables attached to my subnet which allows routing to take palce inside my vpc within the subnet bt my firewall has to permit the trafifc  to get to 
wher its going to , bc if the route tabe is nt created n my ports ar open i stil wont b able to route traffic...its like a virtual touter permiting trafic to be 
routed...then we v another fire wall infront of the server called security grp and once port 22 is open then traffic will be routed to the person to carry out the
task assigned.

2:24:15 ???? yes...... can we use the cli to list the content of s3 bucket
aws s3 ls class 33 willl list the content

if u are to xpalin cloud computing and ervytin dt is involved to it , wev bin able to realisee der ar certain elemrnts to that effet wich we can discuss wit relative ease when
cloud computing is involved...also talking abt cloud and their terms of org or levaraging their resources by a 3rd party ie using a 3rd party infrastructure and those 3rd parties
in computing languages we call dem  called cloud computing providers and dey can provide ntwrking sevrvices, database services,server services,compute serv... & dis ser ar imp
to tk note of when it comes to the diff element of cloud computing  our converstion v genral tailored towards that direction n all wev delibrated on is to ensure that end
to end exercise is been achieved seemlessly wit relative ease. 

"###############the diff aspect we hv been able to cover.......... read up cloudcomputing script
1. aws cloud computing

What is Cloud Computing ?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including 
  - servers,
  - storage,  
  - databases, 
  - networking, 
  - software, 
  - analytics, 
  - and more
 over the Internet (“the cloud”)  hosted at a remote data center managed
 by a cloud services provider (CSP).
   CSP = aws, GCP, Azure, alibaba, vmware, salesforce, oracle, ibm, 

 aws cloud = 
  - servers,  e.g    = ec2 instances  
  - severless, e.g   = Lambda functions,
  - storage,         = ebs, efs,elastic file system, s3, 
  - databases,  when we get into conatiner     = rds,relational databases e.g [ mySQL, mariaBD, posgressSQL, arura,  ], nonRDS[ dynamoDB,  ]
  - networking,  = vpc, creating private ntwrk in aws
  - software,   to create ec2 instance we nid a sfware to create the server resources = ami, SDLC, hw to automate task in aws
  - analytics,  hw to analyze waht is happening in aws = CloudWatch, 
  - and more  
  - security     =aws security services 

  Netflix = entirely run on S3  bucket, jst one service of aws is makn the coy a multi time billion coy
wit the help of cloud computing u can easily become a millionaire frm the comfort of ur room if u understand a few of these services


21:19  ...IAM = identity and access mgt
=====================
e.g if u wrk for netflix
Netflix ---   
   DevOps Engineers   
   Developers .. all these pipo ar granted access to aws resources, therefore who shud access these resource is very imp
so the serVice that is used to decide who access aws resources is called IAM among others, 

AWS COVERS 2 THINGS: .. so u can finish this course and work as any of this 
Cloud Engineering  
Infrastructure Engineering
so when we ar managing this resources thses ar all the infrat that nids to be managed:servers,
  - storage,  - databases, - networking,- software,- analytics, - and more
in managing infrastruture, we can :Infrastructure MGT [ create, view, update, delete, modify, grant access ] 
and dis can be done using GUI ... E.g chnaging the name of my server , vpc .. we ar managing dis frm the console n u realise when u do dis thers high possiblity of error
so apart frm using console we can use files 
===========================

########## HW CAN THESE RESOURCES BE MANAGED???????
generally WE CAN use 
CONSOLE  = GUI   e.g creating servers, vpc in aws :
   Prune to errors 
   Time consuming 
   Visibility is challenging  
   limited automation - 5%  

also using Commands = CLI  = aws s3 ls :
   Prune to errors 
   Time consuming 
   Visibility is challenging  
   limited automation - 55%  
   It cannot be easily replayed or redeployed
   it can't be version controlled  

 ########## THE BEST OPTION .....we can also use IaC and we r going to see d dif level of automation it brings to d table  = codes    = files  = IaC / Terraform  :
   IAC wil cover terraform, we can use a tool called terraform, wit terform i can create a file,, e.g i can wrote  asimple teraform code to create vpc
   It is not Prune to errors 
   saves time  
   Visibility is very easly  
   great automation - 99%  
   It can be easily replayed [dev/stage/prod]
   it can be version controlled   
****** IN OUR ENviron, we use all GUI, CLI and IAC, BUT WE  mostly manage infrasture using infrastructure as a code 

resource "aws_vpc" e.g i want to create a vpc for tesla  "tesla-dev" {
  cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/24", i wnt to crate a vpc wit 200ip addreses
  instance_tenancy = "default"
  tags{
    Name = "tesla-be"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}

i can easily use dis same file in d stage environment, it can be easily replayed or reployed in the dev,stage &prod, i can version control the file using git wit dif branches
ie in the script ill change the environ from dev to stage or prod

resource "aws_vpc" "tesla-stage" {
  cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/24"
  instance_tenancy = "default"
  tags{
    Name = "tesla-fe"
    Environment = "stage"
  }
}
=========================================
Team members can manage resources using the console, cli or IaC.
However for that to happen  there must be authenticated and authorise    

IAM: in AWS , This is a key security service in aws used for  
     authentication  and 
     authorisation for Engineers and other team members to run different tasks. 
 aws-account: U CAN ACCess aws account as a :
   root-User =   
   IAM-USER  = 
changing from vpc to the IAM  dashboard it changes frm ohio to global

vpc= regional and IAM is global

Access management: can be accessed to 
  IAM User groups = we can hv a grop for and assign policies to grps
    managers [AdminAccess] , ie managers can do evrytin
    developers, [VPCREADACCESS, S3FULLACCESS, EC2READACCESS ] therfore e.g he can launch ec2 instances ,so d developer must conact the manger or james bc they hv full access
    Engineers [VPCFULLACCESS, S3FULLACCESS, EC2FULLACCESS]   
  IAM Users       = simon [VPCREADACCESS] , class33, James[VPCFULLACCESS]   
  IAM Roles
 policy is an object in aws that define permission
  IAM Policies - are Permissions that can be assigned to users/groups/IAM-Roles
               e.g of policy can be : 1. VPCREADACCESS / 2. VPCFULLACCESS  

Ticket00133:
  Create iam user account access for; Class33, Simon and James  
  Create user-group access for; managers and developers & Engineers
  Assign admin access to the managers group    
  assign VPCFULLACCESS, S3FULLACCESS, EC2FULLACCESS to the Engineers group
  Add Simon to the manager's group  
  add james to the developers group  
  Assign EC2READACCESS to class33 user

IQ: Which tasks is an IAM user with admin access unable to do? Billing  

********1:15:19.. it is imp to knw that Users can have either:
  console access [userName and password and accountID]  or 
  programatic access using [accessKey and secretAccessKey]
  to aws resources    

*******prOGRAMMATIC ACCESS ... the keys gives us programmatic access, we can mk API calls 
******IN MOBAXT- JUmpserver sudo hostname js , sudo su - esc-user- aws s3 l3 : it says unable to locate credentials, by running aws configure. 
**** in aws: global- iam or security credentials of simon- create aces key- command- i undersand -nxt-create - copy
1;19;18 

   accessKey      =  AKIAUGAPXTS7AGZNQ600
   secretAccessKey=  0OeifliOM4J0lUbOLPvDFDP/Vb4QNwN6haIxyI24

*****1:24 RUN TASK IN CLI.. MOBAX 
in windows system ,when u run aws s3 l3 it says command nt found so ...install aws cli in windows system (in google seaRCH aws cli install and download n install).. 
then run aws s3 ls & now we can run aws configure, it wil ask for the keys then paste acess key id and secret acces key id -defaullt region :ohio-default output:
we can choose table or jason-, run aws s3 ls and we can see/list the  s3 bucket ,, wwe can also try the same in the jumpserver and get the same result 

##### the keys gives us programmatic access, we can mk API calls .,, with d keys u can acess n mange resources in my account  
 if we say ...sudo yum remove awscli and run aws s3 ls , it says no such file
sudo yum install awscli ... aws  --version   .. 

******8we can grant and restrict access.... if we remove simon frm the mangers grp if he run aws s3 ls, he  cant get a response bc d acess keys are his n hes removed 
## we can go to iam,-users- simons- permission: we can add him to a grp , or we can attach policies directly :amazons3readonly-add 
now if he run thwe command again , he gets a response
**** ** aws s3 mb s3://class33 ... name is class33....he trys to create bucket bt he cant bc he can list but not create 
to grant his accress to craete : add permison: attach: s3 full access- add ..... (the action for s3 is *) and now hes able to craete
when we are creating a bucket, we start wit the url ..s3://
to list aws s3 mb s3://class33

1:40:30 we cant list the content of a bucket we dnt own 
we can use permision to ensure that users can be able to perform specific tasks


1:42,, 
*****yes ,,,,   CAN I MANAGE MY AWS RESOURCES DIRECTLY WITHOUT CONNECTING TO ANY SERVER THAT HV CREATED IN AWS  

google, aws ec2 command line list instances, ,, all the commands are availble, i dnt v to cram dem,, 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-ec2-instances.html

still using simon credential who doesnt v ecs instance permisison
1:45:50 ******aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=MyInstance" now we can replace my instance with 
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=webserver" ,, we can decribe inrances like dis
now paste in mobaxterm ,,unknown output type: jason ... then he typed aws configure and  json for default output format   
then paste... : aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=appserver" ,, so all d instances wit d name appserver is what ill want to see
but we got unauthorized creditials, so 
i have to go bk to add permisison and grant him ec2 full ec2 intsance permission and also add him to managers grp
so nnow in mobaxterm we can see all d instances wit d name appserver, all their details, parameters 

##### we can also terminate instances from the command line ,
jst copy n pate this command with the ipadresses attached  

aws ec2 describe-vpcs | jq -r '.Vpcs[]|.VpcId+" "+(.Tags[]|select(.Key=="Name").Value)+" "+.CidrBlock'
to describe vpc ...aws ec2 describe-vpcs

we can also search... show aws vpc commands,, we can also create Ebs volume
https://www.bluematador.com/learn/aws-cli-cheatsheet

we can from the command line n with the iac

2:00 aws eks get-clustters
aws eks list-clusters

**8***88  I DNT understand
2:06:00 I CAN PERFORM MY TASK DIRECXTLY ON MY WINDOWS SYSTEM WITHOUT CONNECTING TO MY EC2 INSTANCE

WHEN am working frm gitbash am working directly on my windows system,, am using my windows system to manage aws resources
with an ssh either mobx or gitbash install in my computer i can connect/acess my server wich is in aws cloud, to manage my task in aws account i can use commands or 
console ... to use commands i can connect to my aws instance n use commands or i can jst run directly using gitbash or mobaterm
..my understanding,,i bliv to use commands, i dnt v to ssh into my server, i jst v to run aws configure and authenticate with my keys 

apart from simon being authentictae with the keys he is also authorized via these policies
2:06:37 if i ssh into my server (using mobaxterm) then am manging my aws resources frm d ec2 instance (i bliv dats the console option)
at work dis 2scenerios wil playout, wher ucan either shh into my server to perform task or i can perform it directly on my windows or
mac system

USING jumpserver for dis illustration
**** when i run aws configure, it creates an account, it creats  afile called : .aws
ll .aws/to see who owns the file
cat .aws/config to see the configure file inside it 
cat .aws/credentials
we can delet rm -rf .aws/
ls -a to check the list of files that starts wit a ,,,, now ders no .aws
if we run aws s3 ls .... itv says no credentials 

*********but is der anytin i can do to b able to acess these resource.... ie attaching Iam roles
yes i can use IAM roles, these are policies/permissions that can be attcahed to another aws resource..[ec2 Instances, eks, ecs,etc.] 
to permit the resource manage other resources based on the Policies attached to the role
iamRoles are Policies/Permissions like [ VPCFULLACCESS, EC2FULLACCESS ] 

******* 2:12:50 TO ATTACH IAM ROLES TO MY JUMP SERVER
select the server-action:secrity:modify iam role-create IAM role-aws service-ec2-nxt-tick any permission- nxt-name of role- create
we can add more permissions if we wnt- create anoda role   .. roles-create role-aws-use case: select e.g eks-nxt-nxt-rolename-create
back to the server -select role frm drop box-update 

******** back to my jumpserver, when i run aws s3 ls ,, now we are authenticated

to install aws cli software
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-help.html
https://aws.amazon.com/cli/


Identity providers ... ther arev other identity providers we can use wit aws to mange more access 
Account settings


diff btw s3 bucket and ebs ,,, check the storgae part of the power point 
check frm pg 34...s3 buckect is na object storage n it doesnt require creating any mount point,, while ebs volume is a block storgae requiring a mount point
if i share a mnovie in my s3 bucket the whole class/ a thousand plus can can watch it at the same time,, dats why it has multiple gigabyte per sec

ebs is block 
efs is  file
s3 is object storage
