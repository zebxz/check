if u are to xpalin cloud computing and ervytin dt is involved to it , wev bin able to realisee der ar certain elemrnts to that effet wich we can discuss wit relative ease when
cloud computing is involved...also talking abt cloud and their terms of org or levaraging their resources by a 3rd party ie using a 3rd party infrastructure and those 3rd parties
in computing languages we call dem  called cloud computing providers and dey can provide ntwrking sevrvices, database services,server services,compute serv... & dis ser ar imp
to tk note of when it comes to the diff element of cloud computing  our converstion v genral tailored towards that direction n all wev delibrated on is to ensure that end
to end exercise is been achieved seemlessly wit relative ease. 

"###############the diff aspect we hv been able to cover.......... read up cloudcomputing script
1. aws cloud computing

What is Cloud Computing ?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including 
  - servers,
  - storage,  
  - databases, 
  - networking, 
  - software, 
  - analytics, 
  - and more
 over the Internet (“the cloud”)  hosted at a remote data center managed
 by a cloud services provider (CSP).
   CSP = aws, GCP, Azure, alibaba, vmware, salesforce, oracle, ibm, 

 aws cloud = 
  - servers,  e.g    = ec2 instances  
  - severless, e.g   = Lambda functions,
  - storage,         = ebs, efs,elastic file system, s3, 
  - databases,  when we get into conatiner     = rds,relational databases e.g [ mySQL, mariaBD, posgressSQL, arura,  ], nonRDS[ dynamoDB,  ]
  - networking,  = vpc, creating private ntwrk in aws
  - software,   to create ec2 instance we nid a sfware to create the server resources = ami, SDLC, hw to automate task in aws
  - analytics,  hw to analyze waht is happening in aws = CloudWatch, 
  - and more  
  - security     =aws security services 

  Netflix = entirely run on S3  bucket, jst one service of aws is makn the coy a multi time billion coy
wit the help of cloud computing u can easily become a millionaire frm the comfort of ur room if u understand a few of these services


21:19  ...IAM = identity and access mgt
=====================
e.g if u wrk for netflix
Netflix ---   
   DevOps Engineers   
   Developers .. all these pipo ar granted access to aws resources, therefore who shud access these resource is very imp
so the serVice that is used to decide who access aws resources is called IAM among others, 

AWS COVERS 2 THINGS: .. so u can finish this course and work as any of this 
Cloud Engineering  
Infrastructure Engineering
so when we ar managing this resources thses ar all the infrat that nids to be managed:servers,
  - storage,  - databases, - networking,- software,- analytics, - and more
in managing infrastruture, we can :Infrastructure MGT [ create, view, update, delete, modify, grant access ] 
and dis can be done using GUI ... E.g chnaging the name of my server , vpc .. we ar managing dis frm the console n u realise when u do dis thers high possiblity of error
so apart frm using console we can use files 
===========================

########## HW CAN THESE RESOURCES BE MANAGED???????
generally WE CAN use 
CONSOLE  = GUI   e.g creating servers, vpc in aws :
   Prune to errors 
   Time consuming 
   Visibility is challenging  
   limited automation - 5%  

also using Commands = CLI  = aws s3 ls :
   Prune to errors 
   Time consuming 
   Visibility is challenging  
   limited automation - 55%  
   It cannot be easily replayed or redeployed
   it can't be version controlled  

 ########## THE BEST OPTION .....we can also use IaC and we r going to see d dif level of automation it brings to d table  = codes    = files  = IaC / Terraform  :
   IAC wil cover terraform, we can use a tool called terraform, wit terform i can create a file,, e.g i can wrote  asimple teraform code to create vpc
   It is not Prune to errors 
   saves time  
   Visibility is very easly  
   great automation - 99%  
   It can be easily replayed [dev/stage/prod]
   it can be version controlled   
****** IN OUR ENviron, we use all GUI, CLI and IAC, BUT WE  mostly manage infrasture using infrastructure as a code 

resource "aws_vpc" e.g i want to create a vpc for tesla  "tesla-dev" {
  cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/24", i wnt to crate a vpc wit 200ip addreses
  instance_tenancy = "default"
  tags{
    Name = "tesla-be"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}

i can easily use dis same file in d stage environment, it can be easily replayed or reployed in the dev,stage &prod, i can version control the file using git wit dif branches
ie in the script ill change the environ from dev to stage or prod

resource "aws_vpc" "tesla-stage" {
  cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/24"
  instance_tenancy = "default"
  tags{
    Name = "tesla-fe"
    Environment = "stage"
  }
}
=========================================
Team members can manage resources using the console, cli or IaC.
However for that to happen  there must be authenticated and authorise    

IAM: in AWS , This is a key security service in aws used for  
     authentication  and 
     authorisation for Engineers and other team members to run different tasks. 
 aws-account: U CAN ACCess aws account as a :
   root-User =   
   IAM-USER  = 
changing from vpc to the IAM  dashboard it changes frm ohio to global

vpc= regional and IAM is global 

Assignement:
Ticket-AS110:
  Group aws services covered so far based on Global, Regional and Availability Zones
  vpc = 

Access management: can be accessed to 
  IAM User groups = we can hv a grop for and assign policies to grps
    managers [AdminAccess] , ie managers can do evrytin
    developers, [VPCREADACCESS, S3FULLACCESS, EC2READACCESS ] therfore e.g he can launch ec2 instances ,so d developer must conact the manger or james bc they hv full access
    Engineers [VPCFULLACCESS, S3FULLACCESS, EC2FULLACCESS]   
  IAM Users       = simon [VPCREADACCESS] , class33, James[VPCFULLACCESS]   
  IAM Roles
 policy is an object in aws that define permission
  IAM Policies - are Permissions that can be assigned to users/groups/IAM-Roles
               e.g of policy can be : 1. VPCREADACCESS / 2. VPCFULLACCESS  

Ticket00133:
  Create iam user account access for; Class33, Simon and James  
  Create user-group access for; managers and developers & Engineers
  Assign admin access to the managers group    
  assign VPCFULLACCESS, S3FULLACCESS, EC2FULLACCESS to the Engineers group
  Add Simon to the manager's group  
  add james to the developers group  
  Assign EC2READACCESS to class33 user   

1:000 CREATE IAM USER
****IAM create user-name -provide access:if i dnt tick it d user cant come to aws axccount, he can only access aws resources tru the console or cli ,iaC- USER TYPE:IAM -
CUSTOM pass-user must neww pss:untick-nxt-add uyser to grp- CREATE
