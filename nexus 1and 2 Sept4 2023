42:34                     WALK US THROUGH YOUR ARTIFACTS MG8 WITH NEXUS 

   cAN YOU USE THE ANSWER TO THIS QUestion as a project your working on 
like tell us a project you are managing at the moment


ANS:

My project at the moment for the past 6nmths, i hv been tasked, am basically incharge of managing our artifacts 

is that a serious task to mg8 artcifacts 

what is the mg8 of artifacts ?? what does it involve 
walk me tru your artifacts management with nexux

45:40
thank you very much for that question
when it comes to artifacts, its very imp in the software development lifecycle and the way artifacts are managed bc artifacts are deployable  packages
packages that  appl servers  can understand, can interpret , thats what artifacts are all about

so in our env we use nexus to mg8 artifacts alongside our build servers which is jenkins on our pipeine 
so when artifacts acre created those artifacts are uploaded into nexus
so as part of my task, hv been able to setup a nexus server 
and in our env i was tasked to setup a nexus server on a redhat9 instance, i have done that before on REDhat8 and 7 instances , where ill donwload the 
software of nexus
and ill extract the software , when that happen, i hv nexus running on my pipeline , one hv installed nexus i ensure that nexus has started, its running
afterwhic i go to the nexus url , nexus account and i create repositories/artifactories wherewher artifacts can be uploaded into and generally i create both
snapshot repositories and releases repositories, the repositories is where i will upload my artifacts into 
again for the artifacts to be created, it rQuires dependencies, it requires pluggins , so hv equally used nexus as my maven proxy refactory where artifacts
are not directly gotten frm the maven central repository ,that is to say pluggins and depencies for us to be able to create artifacts can only be gotten
into our build server via the proxy server which runs in neuxs
its also worth explaning that hv equally been able to upload diff classes of artifacts including:
jar/war/ear , npm ie for node js applictaion, docker images

SDLC, WHAT DO WE CONSIDER WHEN IT COMES TO A QUQLITY SOFTWARE, NEXUS, DISASTER MGT/DISASTER RECOVERY,  MAVEN / NEXUS INTEGRATION,  NEXUS INSTALLATION, CONFIGURING THE NEXUS SERVER (change the context/access path and port number)
  NEXUS DIR STRUCTURE,  UPLOADING ARTIFACTS FROM NEXUS TO MAVEN (changing nexus passwd),CREATING REPOSITORY IN NEXUS, Who decides on codeQuality:,   What’s the difference between code coverage and code quality.  



sudo systemctl restart nexus

 what is 400 error and 500 error  , 400 error, there was an error with my ip address, i didnt add  /engrcecilia for nexus server

                                 

                                                 START

SDLC
WHy do  we add sonarqube in our software development life cycle


We dont just develop, build and deploy, we need to first check the quality of work done by developers, we have to validate the code so the code goes to the
code validation 
or qualification, so we use sonarqube to ensure that the codes are written as expected.
sonar qube comes with:
soanrqube scanner and server
The scanner scans through the code and moves it into the server which has a compute engine for computation and calculation theres also elastic search

Database                                                                           server ip: port number
web-server- so we can access sonarqube on the browser and to do this we need the server ip:port number 9000 & it will then request for the username &PW or 
token which is a 
representation of username & PW

We also determine our benchmark ie our standards for quality software: to define our standard we need to determine quality profiles and set rules, we can 
bring this rules
together create quality gates.
quality gate is usually a combination of conditions 

                    


                               WHAT DO WE CONSIDER WHEN IT COMES TO A QUQLITY SOFTWARE
                  
14:50   

                         Conditions:
     this is                  { 1) code coverage:   > 85% if less then 85 its not a good software 
                              {2) Duplicated lines <4%, vulunerability <1,  code smells <5, bug =0, security hot spot =0
     what the 
     the company will                 We are explaining that
     decide                     {7) Developers must USE BEST RECOMMENDED CODING STANDARDS






                               NEXUS
we hv 2 scripts for it to work 
next time run the 2script seperately to install nexus



19:00
****************** 

           Nexus

What can be done if the packages are deleted IN MAVEN?
What can be done if the packages can't be access 
because the build server is down?


                            
                                    DISASTER MGT/DISASTER RECOVERY

Disaster recovery:
23:02  ....  Disaster management:
  We need to create backups for artifacts in artifactories to do this backup we can use other NEXUS or JFROG (the 2 common artifactories), Its like a 
repository where we 
store /upload artifacts. we are backing up the war files

  *******  which type of artifacts are stored here  ??


20:53
in our environment, once the artifacts are created in maven, we upload the jar packages, war and ear to the artifactory
we didnt deploy to the client straight from MAVEN 
even if we want to deploy from maven, we should have an artifcatory, a store 
so we are going to create an artifactory and another name for it is repo
nexus artifactory wil back up our build artifacts
therfore if we are deploying from the maven server and the deployment fails, the maven server goes down in the deployment process is there any 
other location where we can get our artifacts from ? yes we do.
In a situation where the MAVEN server goes down in the deployment, we just discontinue the process and pull from our artifactories that's how we manage the 
end to end process

nexus and jfrog , these are our artifactories

     so lets see how to mg8 this end to end process

****** what willl happen if a developers laptop or environment breaks down   ??

23:50   ANS:    
when developers are writing code, they commit changes in their code to local repositories 
developers push their commits to the remote repository in github, once they push it, if their local env crashes, are wont suffer the impact bc he already
pushed it and so we have the code in github, therfore its distributed , git is a distributed version control system, so if thers a problem, we can easily recover
from the disaster
GIT = DVCs, so where there is a problem we can easily recover from the disaster


                                                  EXAMPLES OF ARTIFACTS

we are going to be creating an artifactory repository in maven where we can upload artifacts
  **********To install in windows, choco install tree
   
Examples of artifacts:    
in maven we can create an artifactory repository where we can upload artifacts
this artifactory can store  jar/war/ear artifacts/packages
Artifactory Repository    packages                      :
  maven Repository       [jar/war/ear] 
  NodeJs Repository      [npm, node packages ]   if we have a NodeJS project we are managing = Node Repo:npm node packages
  yum   Repository       [ yum packages]                   ****** this is meant for holding and managing RPM packages, so when you run the 
                                                     yum install,the command goes to the yum repo and search for the free package or any package you want to install
  chocolatey repo.       [choco packages]        
  apt  Repository        [ apt packages]
  docker
  terraform  

artifacts to be created depends on the project's language:
  java   --> app.jar, maven-web-app.war, boa.ear 
             app.[jar/war/ear]

  docker -->   Docker Image 
               docker build
               docker run 
  NodeJs  -- > NPM Packages = node package manager
  yum --- > yum Packages  =  
            yum install maven git httpd tree
            yum is a package manager for Redhat and CentOS  
  
       yum install maven

  apt  -->  apt install tree 
            apt is a package manager for Ubuntu/Debian linux servers

  chocolatey --> choco install terraform 
             --> chocolatey is a package manager for windows OS  

  brew:     brew install terraform    
         --> brew is a package manager for mac OS  
  
  helm-->  is a package manager for kubernetes

  pip --> is a is a package manager for python

             **1.26..27                       HOW HAVE YOU APPLIED NEXUS IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT

IQ: How have you applied Nexus in your environment?

    have been able to setup and install 
    1. Installation and configuration of the nexus server in Redhat.  
    2. Creating maven-remote-repos[artifactories] in nexus   
    3. uploading java, NodeJs, etc. artifacts into Nexus
    5. retrieving packages from Nexus
    4. Securing the nexus server   
    5. troubleshooting build and uploading related issues  
      Trying to integrate maven & configuring wrong credentials or wrong nexus IP address

IQ: what is your experience with nexus?
    What problems have you encountered with Nexus and how did you   
    resolve it  .

       ********** As we are apply nexus now we are going to be encountering problems


44:00   INstallation       port 8081
45:20   to medium Redhat   Redhat
51:47   ec2user to install
54:12   it will stop to switch user or run the installation as a seperate scripts

                
                                              

                                     WHAT IS NEXUS

Nexus: Is an Open source Artifactory Repository, It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts, We can retrieve artifacts when needed
       Nexus acts as a Disaster recovery server for maven    

JFrog: Is an  Artifactory Repository - it is Licence
       It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts 

Amazon CodeArtifacts:
     It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts 


********* in these application how do we create packages in maven 
in maven we generally run the mvn package goal
(We support Java based application dev't.)


maven goals:
 mvn package  
    This will validate, compile, test and Creates
    artifacts in the target directory

mvn install 
   Creates and store artifacts in maven-local-repo & target directory

mvn deploy: uploads the build artifacts to maven remote repository (nexus), bt before it does this, it will first 
    - validate  ( the file structure)
    - compile   ( the jave classes)
    - test       (run unit test cases)
    - create (artifacts) package in target directory
    - Packages created in mavenlocalrepo   
    - uploads THE PACKAGE to Nexus (Maven remote-repo)



 
                                   MAVEN / NEXUS INTEGRATION,  NEXUS INSTALLATION

QUESTION 
How will MAVEN connect with nexus?
maven and nexus intergration:




43:50   ******** nexus is called jivor type Nexus 

51:16
 ********* we can use scripting for package mgt

54:45  ***** once i run this script , it will break once it switch to nexus user bc i am running the script as ec2user, ec2user is trying to run the script

55:00    ******* therefore run the command one by one using package 

1:07:59  we hv 2 scripts for it to work 
next time run the 2script seperately to install nexus 

** 1:05:40
we want to create a service to run nexus ie we want to run nexus as a service 
we want to create a symbolic link to start nexus inside /etc/unit.d/nexus  dir 
this libk is created because our nexus is found in /opt/nexus/bin        the script to start nexus is called nexus
sudo ln -s /opt/nexus/bin/nexus/etc/unit.d/nexus
sudo systemctl enable nexus 
sudo systemctl start nexus
then start nexus 

****1.06.30 ********* we can also execute a script for nexus to run but it should start when we switched users to become nexus 
so once we switch user and we now opt user thats
so yes we can install nexus as a script, so we should hv 2scripts actually 
the first run as ec2user and the 2nd as nexus user
1.08.05... the line that says  "echo, run _as_user=nexus ; bc we hv to mg8 nexus as a nexus user for security reasons
it shows that nexus service is running as nexus user thats how we are manging nexus 
so we hv installed nexus and nexus is running

hOW DO WE ACCESS NEXUS
pub ip/8081
  1.12.40 default nexus login:   ... i will show u guys how to change it 
  username = admin
  password = admin123


**1.10.10  someone is asking ;
we redirect into the file, not append, redirect bc it can only run as one user
echo, run _as_user=nexus > /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc



etc replaces conf and it contains the configuration files


sudo hostnamectl set-hostname 
nexus Installation:
-------------
 https://www.sonatype.com/download-oss-sonatype
   PUBLIC-IP = 54.85.4.8
   ssh-key   = class30key.pem  
   userName  = ec2-user  
   ssh -i class30key.pem  ec2-user@54.85.4.8                 = RP  
   ssh -i /home/ec2-user/class30key.pem  ec2-user@54.85.4.8  = AP  
   ssh -i /tmp/class30key.pem  ec2-user@54.85.4.8 

 http://54.85.4.8:8081/

 echo  'run_as_user="nexus" ' > /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc
 echo  'run_as_user="nexus" ' > /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc



*********

1:11
Nexus Home directory:
  /opt/nexus                                 *****it is where the nexus software is extracted

http://54.85.4.8:8081/  
default nexus login:
  userName = admin 
  password=admin123



*******so to login = nexus public ip:8081/engrcecilia 
  userName = admin 
  password=admin123




CONFIGURING THE NEXUS SERVER (change the context/access path and port number)
1.18.23 ..... nexus context path inside the nexus-default.properties (inside the nexus-default.properties w ecan chnage nexus port number)
             we can change how we access nexus here by changing the the context path
eg change context path to mylandmarktech
   nexus-context-path=/mylandmarktech
then restart nexus


1:23:00

ls /opt/nexus/etc 
vim/opt/nexus/etc/nexus -default -properties
to change nexus-content-path=/  to   /landmarktech
then 



1.28.10   when we install nexus, it comes with default sttings like defaulf port, we can dcide to change it 
***** we do some configurations based on our security needs eg changing default port to something that suit our environment based on our security policies
because we are heavy on security so most of the time we change default configurations for appl, we want to have our custom setting like changing default context path

****1.29.00 UPLOADING ARTIFACTS FROM NEXUS TO MAVEN 
             maven nexus integrattion
we can change the password 

           CREATING REPOSITORY

1:37
*********** we create maven-remote-repo in nexus , where we will upload our artifacts

we create snapshots and releases Repo in Nexus
when a job is being done, artifacts from the dev branch area

1:42  stored in the sbapshots Repo  while artifacts from the master branch are uploaded in the releases repo

in our environment we talk about the master branch but some company deploy from release branch, we deploy directly from the master branch 


1:44:30
                              MAVEN  NEXUS INTEGRATION

1) Create artifactories {maven-remote-repo] and add them in the distribution
   MGT tag in pom.xml
2) configure nexus login credentials in settings.xml file in the conf dir in the maven server

  ***1.46.43   Therefore in maven we vi pom.xml and replace the snapshot and relaese url with my own 
  ie the link of my snapshot and release repo created in nexus


  No .1 ... continued
   Therefore in maven we vi pom.xml and replace the snapshot and relaese url with my own 
  ie the link of my snapshot and release repo created in nexus


   **************in our environment we are heavy on security most of the time we change default port 
we change default configuration, we want to have our custom setting



****No 2.. continued
1:55:50
   maven needs to be authenticated to be able to upload to nexus 

2:03:40  Therefore we sudo  vim  /opt/maven/conf/settings.xml
and add our nexus credential : we add another copy of 
servername>nexus
username>cecilia
password>admin123


2:14:00 to allow redeployment, we change the hosted setting in the repo in nexus ie we open the repository and in hosted we allow redeploy
 OR
we vi pom.xml and change 0.02 to 0.03

1:23:10
to upload into releases we vi pom.xml and remove the - SNAPSHOT  but when we want to upload 

2:36:00

        WHY CAN WE ENABLE DISABLE REDEPLOY 
Most times if we are going to deploy from there, we need to create a new version of the application bc we are ready for deployment. therefore not allowing to
redeploy means that if already have version1 running then you need to create version2 so to send version2 to nexus we vi pom.xml change 001 to 002 nc now we 
are set for deployment but if there is a problem, we can rollback to version1, when you allow redeploy you only update the same version and cant rollback if 
thers a problem
   ****meeeee*** probably bc if it redeploys automatically, it doesnt change in pom.xml and ie it remains as 001, and bc of that when thers a problem you 
cant roll back



2:44   what is 400 error and 500 error  , 400 error, there was an error with my ip address, i didnt add  /engrcecilia for nexus server
2:47 Developers write the pom.xml file, they include the dependencies, pluggin and everything needed, but once the developers have commited the pom.xml file, the source code
and test cases . it is now the work of the devops engrs to take it from ther and start deploying and while deploying building pipelines, integrating maven
with jenkins, sonaqube , nexus by just vi into the pom file and modify the required area.


2:35:00
we can place our nexus server in a diff AZ from where our maven server is running so that if theres a disaster all our servers dnt go down





*** why is the symbolic path we die in tomcat diff from that of nexus 

**** why do we have to create the dir /etc/unit.d/nexus

inside  /etc/init.d directory we are creating a link for nexus, which is the file to start/run nexus

ALWAYS START NEXUS
sudo su - Nexus
cd/opt
nexus nexus: sudo systemctl enable nexus 
then start nexus 


cd  /opt
ls nexus/
ls nexus/bin
ls nexus/bin/nexus                     **********  file  to start/run nexus


1.11.30       NEXUS DIR STRUCTURE 
/opt/nexus
   bin  = binary files [nexus]  we use thie "nexus" file to run nexus 
    lib  = 
    etc  = configuration files
             nexus-default.properties  
   temps; for some temporary files 
1.05.7 ..... there is no conf, but "etc" the "etc" dir contains configuration files 
also no logs dir ; logs ; where if anthing that is happening we will see it in the logs



    




Who decides on codeQuality:
===========================
Code Quality is generally a Team decision =   
Sprint planning meeting  
1. 25 rules --- Quality Profiles = javaAppQP    
2. Conditions -- Quality GATE = 
   code coverage => 90%


Is nexus built from a different env't  :
  We leverage aws cloud  servers = AZ  
  us-east-1  = NV [AZ1 , ... AZ6]  



What’s the difference between code coverage and code quality

2:31:24    nexus
 we can decide that 25rules - have to be set for our quality profiles diff between code quality and code coverage
2:37:40 
code quality is the umbrella that code coverage comes under
code quality means that developers should write good software, should take their time in writing their codes and ensure the SOftware meets all our quality 
expectations and
code coverage is part of code quality and it means asking what is the proportion of unittestcases written by developers 
eg
10lines of code means they should write 10unit test cases.
