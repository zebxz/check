SCRIPTING 1&2

  QUESTION   1:45:22

you were explaning abt the go goland, the powershell, talking abt the xml, i just want to know do they really perform the same function or diff functions

ANS:
Not actually the same function , but u may want to write a script to deploy appl and youchoose to write it in go or goland language , or you write in bash shell scripting 
or the language your are versatile in or the lanuguage used in your project
so you work in landmark , which language are you goin to hv a mastery of it goin to be based on the language we use in our own project

WE Hv seen how we can run this scripts by manually typing the commands to execute them 
so my quetson is are we still goin to to go tru how we can automate this scripts automatically , ie mayb ur system restarts and the script starts automatically 

ANS;

yes, we are goin to look at some of those things how we can achieve automation in scripting  using a cron table , not even your that your system start , thats just one thing
i can decide that my server all the data base  shud backup at midnight , how do you do that , you use a cron table 
u write a script that will backup all your data bases at midnight

thats why in devops engrs can hv multiple jobs bc they can give you a ticket thats a repeating action , u write a script taht can run that job ,so u just always checck the 
logs to ensure script is running as expected

 ******* From bootcamp Dec26 

CHRIS  said he was using jenkins to do a build but was always having a fail

proff:
    if theres a problem ,you dnt just first dive into your pom.xml file
the first thing is to check the logs, if we are building in jenkins, thats what we call console output 
u go to the console output and try to identify what cud be the cause of the problem, if the cause of the problem will need that i get into pom.xml to check then il do that 
if the cause is for you to talk to dvelopers to inform them to check their code , it cannot run bc the compilers they hv defined is the wrong compilers they shud check
their pluggins , the pluggins defined in pom.xml are not the pluggins the job neeeds to run , so they shud wrk on it and define the correct pluggins , 
so if theres a problem check the logs

    Thank you for this question

in my env i am incharge of manging artifacts , and as part of my job, i set up my nexus artifactory  by creating a nexus serevr, ensuring that nexus is fully installed, 
ensure thats its running as expected, i create artifactories, repositories in nexus n i use the artifcatory  repository url to modify my project file which is pom.xml,
this wil permit us to upload artifacts into this artifcatories, when we build frm the development branch, artifacts are uploaded into the nexus releases repository .. 59:00
when we build form the master or the relaese branch, artifacts are uploaded into the release repository
i was tasked to upload some artifacts into the release repository and i realised for some reason i kept getting build fail and when i checked the logs i realised i was using 
the wrong version in my pom.xml, instaed of ensuring that the versioning is tagged to releases it was tagged to snapshot, so i quickly went to my pom.xml modified the version
used the corret version which was snapshot and once i had to rebuld again via my pipeline that failure never existed because it was now uploading artifacts into the snapshot
repository that was expected.
