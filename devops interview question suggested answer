Q4. Tell me about the hardest day you’ve had as a DevOps Engineer?
Sample Answer:
Perhaps the hardest day I have had as a DevOps Engineer was whilst working on a project for a client in
a previous role. This was a cloud-based project and, despite having an initial set brief to work towards,
the client continually changed the project specifications. Due to the client’s unfortunate haphazard
approach to the project requirements, the team started to show signs of stress and frustration. I spoke to
the team members and explained how important it was that we still provided a high level of service.
Although it was frustrating to have to continually change our approach to the project, this was our
opportunity to dig deep, maintain flexibility and also use patience and resilience to get through the project
to a satisfactory conclusion. Although the project was very difficult to work on, we stuck together as a
team, adapted as and when required and successfully completed everything the client wanted, on time
and to the final requested specification.
5. What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Sample Answer:
I would say my core strengths are my technical knowledge and expertise. I have built up lots of
experience in various DevOps positions over the years, and I feel I can bring a wealth of knowledge and
experience to your team. Other strengths include my communication and interpersonal skills. This means
I can fit into a team quickly, and I will always be unselfish in my work and ensure the needs of the team
and the organization always come first. Another strength of mine is my level of commercial awareness. I
understand that, in order for your business to be successful, I have to excel in the position. In respect of
my weakness, the only one I have is the fact I have trouble sometimes letting go of projects. I tend to get
engrossed in projects and I become quite passionate about them. Having said that, I am learning to
complete DevOps projects quickly and then move on to the next one, and I will always take onboard
constructive feedback from my peers and managers in a positive way as I am someone who is keen to
continually grow, learn and develop.
Q6. You are giving a presentation to a number of non-technical company managers. They have no
technical knowledge and they are struggling to understand your presentation. How would you
adapt your presentation, so they all understand?
Sample Answer:

DEVOPS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
I would use visual explanations that they were all familiar with. For example, if the room was full of people
who had a passion for cars, which lots of people do, I would use the construction of a car as the analogy
when describing my technical solution or idea. For example, I might say:
“If you try to imagine a car travelling along the road, the wheels enable the car to travel forward based on
their shape. If you apply the same principle to my solution, you will see that object A is able to move forward
because of object B.”, or something similar to that example that they can all relate to. I would also utilize
drawings and diagrams, as the visual aspect is far easier to understand and follow.
Q7. Where do you see yourself in the future?
Sample Answer:
I am looking long-term stable employment with an organization that is ambitious and that is also going
places. On that basis, I plan to stay here for as long as you want me. You are a great organization with a
very strong reputation in your industry. You are also a company that is innovative in its products and
services, and you also understand that, in order for you to maintain your market share, you will have to
continually change and adapt. That means you will continue to be an attractive organization to work for,
so I would like to stay here long term if possible.
Q8. How do you handle stress and pressure at work?
Sample Answer:
Pressure is all part of working in DevOps, and if I am being entirely truthful, I believe I actually work to the
best of my ability when I am under pressure. Having said that, stress and pressure need to be managed
effectively so that we can all work together to achieve the aims of the organization. To begin with, I believe
in proper, effective planning of both time, tasks and projects. Planning helps significantly reduce stress
within the workplace. Secondly, I believe in maintaining a positive mindset. If you are a positive, selfmotivated and determined person, this rubs off on your work colleagues. Finally, I look after myself outside
of work and I eat well, and whilst I am not a massive fitness fantastic, I often go walking and carry out
physical exercise to clear my head and this also helps to reduce stress, too.
Q9. What does DevOps mean to you and what is its purpose in our organization?
Sample Answer:
DevOps is all about facilitating a stronger alignment between IT and the business as a whole. This is
achieved by working with IT developers to ensure effective coordination and integration between
business operations, development and testing. DevOps, to me, is about improving organizational culture

by implementing the right infrastructure and using the right tools to achieve the strategic goals of the
business.
Q10. Tell me how DevOps differs from Agile / SDLC?
Sample Answer:
I like to think of DevOps as a culture. That is, it is a culture of all teams collaborating together; both the
development teams and operations teams. This collaboration means continuous development, feedback,
improvements, and high-quality deliverables can be made swiftly and efficiently. Agile is an interactive
framework, with qualities like those I have already mentioned such as the collaboration of all staff, customer
feedback, on-going improvements and rapid releases of content. SDLC, or Software Development Life
Cycle, focuses on ensuring the software is fully functional for the users by focussing on the design,
maintenance and development workflows. Principally, Agile and SDLC are aimed at development teams,
but DevOps ties everyone together collectively (both the development team and operations team) to create
a more efficient workflow. Although there are often comparisons differentiating DevOps from Agile and
SDLC, in reality, the Agile framework, can still be applied under the DevOps culture.
Q11. What is an inode on Linux?
Sample Answer:
Essentially an inode is an administrative data source that stores a file's metadata i.e., the data needed to
read the file. For example, the read, write permissions, the file type, and file size etc. is stored in the inode.
Every file in Linux has an inode and each inode is identified with an integer number.
Q12. In your opinion, which are the top DevOps tools and what are they used for?
Sample Answer:
I have worked with many DevOps tools and the ones I think are best are: Kamatera is a cloud provider that
is used for the deployment of cloud applications. Kamatera is really fast and supports the most popular
applications such as CPanel, NextCloud, OpenVPN, Redis, WordPress, MySQL, node.js, & phpMyAdmin.
Jenkins is another DevOps tool I recommend as it's an open-source tool that big companies like LinkedIn
use as an automation server. By distributing work on multiple machines and platforms, it is great for
automating, building, and the deployment in projects. The other tool I feel is one of the best is Git. Git is a
version control system, that in my opinion, is the best for teams with different geographical locations. Its
simplicity to learn and implement by teams makes this a top DevOps tool.

Q13. Tell me how you'd go about optimizing a database?
Sample Answer:
When optimizing a database, there are some essential areas I would cover right away. Firstly, I would 
index the database. I would specifically look to index "group by", "where", and "order by" columns. This will
ensure unique records, speed up select query time, and allow for better sorting. I often see too many tables
used in join statements. This can cause big optimization issues, so I always look to use less than a dozen
joins for each query. Another common problem database problem is too many columns. As a rule of thumb,
I try to keep this down to under 100 columns and will insert logical breaks. For instance, if a customer can
have multiple email addresses, I may create a separate table for email addresses that reference back to
the "customer_id". This can be a huge saver on CPU. Finally, I would ensure there are no null values (the
absence of any value in a column). Null values can cause a database to not behave as intended when
running queries. I would potentially define a default value if the database doesn't require a mandatory
value.
Q14. What is garbage collection programming?
Sample Answer:
Garbage collection is memory management in software. Often referred to as just the "Collector" it will
attempt to reclaim memory/garbage allocated to objects that are no longer used by the program. There are
essentially three forms of Garbage Collection; Mark and sweep, Copying collection, Reference counting.
Garbage collection can save time for programmers by reducing the need for many functions, but at the
same time, it can be performance-intensive as it has to run regularly to check object references and clean
up.
Q15. Talk me through the steps you would follow when checking physical memory on Linux?
Sample Answer:
The simplest way to check the physical memory on Linux server is to use the "free" command. I would do
this by firstly opening the command line, and then I would type the command free followed by the byte
format I would like the results displayed in such as and -g for gigabytes, or -m for megabytes. Within the
results presented, I would look at the line starting with "Mem:" to see the physical memory.
