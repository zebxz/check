connection timed out , port22 need to be open

so are looking on hw we are able to manage our infrastruture 
i think we hv convinced our selves that terfm wil be the ideal option bc it can be reuseable, theres version control and thers also terfrm workspaces

what is cloud formation ???????
the video for locking the statefile with diamondDB    ????


1:19:55

  QUESTION:
1)i was goin tru an env and i noticed they deveolped a docker file that had lifecycle when developing it
so is there a way that terfrm options can enter docker files bc when you were doing file i didnt see smt like life cycle in it but i saw that meta argument of life cycle which
is in terfrm in docker file

ANS:
ITS TRUE THAT there are some things which you will see more of it based on what we have covered already bt talking abt life cycle that is in terfrm in docker file , you may 
hv to share that with me personally let me lookat it 
but the base line is that if you have  a mastery of what is expected of frm which is the basics there are a lot of docker files you can play around with in dockerhub bc all
the images in docker hub has an associated docker file 
and for the official images ther docker file are mostly in github wher you will see other options there

2)
what is the better way to provison on aws
bc i went tru the aws solution architech course and they were heavily on cloud formation 
so is it terrafrm or cloudformation

ANS:
MOST ATTIMES YOU MAY BE exposed to both of them based on what you want to provision but generally companies are serching fo terfrm 
bc it cloud alcostic meaning you can use the same code across multiple cloud just by changing the variables 

how are we able to configure our resources
how can we configure our resources in aws and how can we configure our servers that we hv created 
so this has to do with ansible 
we will be looking at how powerful ansible is 

Configuration Management: - 
diff Tools:
  Ansible - PUSH -- AGENTLESS 
  Chef - Pull
  Puppet      and their playbooks are called cookbooks
  SaltStack

3:00 .......... using diagram to explain

with the help of ansible, we can push configuration to the servers and the configuration can perform diff tasks
ansible can perfrorm severaltask , it can group our servers, file mgt, user mgt, etc ,, bt first ansible needes to conect to the host(servers) and for it to do that , it 
wil depend on the host 
e.g windows host will be treated diff frm linux host
it will use ssh pluggin to connect to linux host and for host on windows it will use winrm
Servers:
    UsersMGT
    FilesMGT
    ServicesMGT
    PackagesMGT
    deployments, manage,
    build, test and configure apps 
Ansible is an open source AGENTLESS :
  Configuration Management tool, 
  deployment tool and/or  
  provisioning tool maintained by Redhat


********** 18:00

Ansible can be installed in Linux OS. 
====================================
Ticket01: provision an ec2-instance in aws call ansible using ubuntu 
if given this ticket but you dnt have a clue
Search official documentation for creating aws ec2-instance  .. (terfrm aws_ec2 instance)

21:38 
********** creating our anisible instance uisng terfrm:
he started with creating a file in vscode
vi ec2.tf 
pasted the resources 
we are using this data soure it is going to pull our amazon machine image :   ami  = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id



resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c7217cdde317cfec"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = "subnet-0301f6ce6f3fe5f9c"
  key_name      = "class35"
  security_groups = [ "sg-07fe099f5be5a1aba"  ]
  tags = {
    Name = "ansible"
  }
}


to delete user   sudo userdel ansible 

************38:33   ............. installing ansible in the created ansible server
i wont run this as a script bc if i do it wont give me the result that i want
we are creating a user called ansible 



script 1

#1 Ansible installation in ubuntu using python3-pip
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ansible                            ******* create a hostname
sudo useradd ansible                                            
sudo passwd ansible             **********  add password to ansible
 echo "ansible  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansible
sudo su - ansible
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install ansible --user                                ********** we are installing ansible as ansible meaning that only ansible can run ansible command 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sshpass                              *********** to be able to use password
sudo mkdir /etc/ansible                                ****** creating ansible working dir 
sudo chown -R ansible:ansible /etc/ansible/
touch /etc/ansible/hosts                             ********** thers a file called ansible host file,  creating etc ansible host file , so ill touch the file ,
touch /etc/ansible/anisble.cfg                        ********* the configuration file
ll 
and we hv 2files owned by ansible 

so we hv insatlled ansible 
  **************************************************



script2
****************** this all we would hv done to hv ansible installed  bt since we used python p, we used option1 

#2 Ansible installation in ubuntu using apt repo
Ansible installation in ubuntu
 sudo adduser ansible
 echo "ansible  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansible
 sudo su - ansible
 sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible  
 sudo apt install ansible  -y 

***************************************

*********** 49:14
checking online to knw where he can get the ansible configuration file 
in google in typed ansible.cfg example     and  he found the github link where he said he can find the repository 
https://github.com/dmahler/ansible-template/blob/master/ansible.cfg

he copied the file and pasted in   vi  /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
vi  /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
so now we have this file
we also have the ansible host file
but we dnt have any host for now
so lets try and add host
he went to his aws server  we hv an ansible server, a dbserver, 
for my ansible server, am i able to configure this dbserver ,, yes i can
he went to the etc host file, cos hes needs to create host inventory for his abservers
in aws he copied the public and private ip address as if they are 2diff servers
then pasted it in the host file  , we want to acess ansible related task 
vi  /etc/ansible/hosts               



********* 52:15
since that is the ip address , when it comes to our ansible host inventory file, how are we able to access it
this server it has a user
ansible is goin to connect to this server 
we need to connect to carry out specific task in ansible 

he tried to run ansible command but it says ansible has nt been installed
so if ansible wasnt installed we can also install ansible using package manager 
so he executed this 2comands:
 sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible  
 sudo apt install ansible  -y 

ll/etc/ansible/

we see our  ansible cfg file ,,  so ansible has been installed 

he pinged web server
realised the host file is empty

**********1:1:20

recreating host file
[web]
54.175.72.219 ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/tmp/class35.pem
ansible web -m ping
no response bc we need tocreate the key i the tmp dir
vi tmpclass35.pem
went to his downloads and copied his key and pasted in the file 
ansible web -m ping
if connection timesd out, it means our port is nt open  and also our key is too open so 
chmod 400 /tmp/class35.pem
now we need to open port 22 , the ssh port   , 
so he opened all traffic frm everywher
are you sure you want to continue ........... yes
but to automate this 


 1:09:14         ************ AUTOMATING TASK

Because ansible should be able to run while you are sleeping 

so 
vi  /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

in the hostkey checking area it was commented so we remove the comment
ansible web -m ping
successful

creating another host with the k8s/kubernetes server

in the inventory file add 
vi  /etc/ansible/hosts               
34.233.124.124 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/tmp/kkk.pem
changed  user=ec2-user to ubuntu bc when you craete an ubuntu server the default user is ubuntu ....*********************   1:14:30
vi tmp/kkk.pem
copy and paste the kkk.pem key 
chmod 400 /tmp/kkk.pem

ansible k8s -m ping

we can also ping all the host 
ansible all -m ping 
sucess
success

/etc/ansible/hosts  
[web]
54.175.72.219 ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/tmp/class35.pem

Ansible concepts:
1. Ansible commands:  
    ansible hosts -m module -a "df -f"
      -m=modules
      -a=arguements
  hosts: db / web / app / localhost / all     
      ansible all -m ping
      ansible localhost -m ping

 ansible web -m command -a "df -h"
 ansible localhost -m command -a "df -h"
