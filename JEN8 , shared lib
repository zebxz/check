the video for newrelic & resume preparation

2:07:42 tk advantage of one tin wich jenkins equally has to offer wich is jenkins has a lot of documentaion wich u can read

also, hw can u backup ur jobs in jenkins such dst if it fails u ar able to restore the files u deleted 

?????? is it the mkdir that ill use to mk the jenkins
?/?????????? hw are the APIs generated
?????????  we were able to build with just npm install ,,,  that was without nodejs so whats the need of nodejs

mvn package will (validates, compiles, & test before packaging)

git has to be installed  to pull the code and the repository

**** JENKINS SHARED LIB IS THE CONCEPT OF HAVING A COMMON PIPELINE CODE IN THE VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM THAT CAN BE USED BY ANY NUMBER OF PIPELINES JUST BY REFERENCING 
**** IT. IN FACT, MULTIPLE TEAMS CAN USE THE SAME LIB FOR THEIR PIPELINES.


jenkins Shared Libraries:
  Jenkins pipeline scripts:
  Jenkinsfile
Programming and scripting languages:
  bash-shell scripting
  groovy 

35.32 go tru the note, the SRC and what the variable files do 

HW TO configure jenkins shared lib
  1. Create Shared Libraries 
  2. Configure Library 
       https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/JenkinsSharedLibraries
  3. use library in pipelines script

37:30 **** to config the shared lib -in jenkins- mange jenkins-config sys: global pipelines lib; add: lib name -def ver:master- allow default to over , . include@ lib
- retrival meth: modern-:git- 39.27 then jen lib repo url- save 
*******to use the shared lib ...then add new item- pilpe line - copy the pipeline script and paste -build


32.00*********************************inside his github repo for jenkins shared lib , he has a dir called var and inside var theres a script called common.groovy 

 
JSL:
========
common.groovy
def call(String stageName){    *** we are defining a function called call n it wil depend on the string ; stagename.. we are caling the function based on the stage name
  
  if ("${stageName}" == "Build")  ****** we are defining each of the stage i.e if the $ stage name is = to build then mvn package is the command to run
     {
       sh "mvn clean package"
     }
  else if ("${stageName}" == "SonarQube Report") ** we can equaly run multiple stuff here like the 2 e.g below
     {
       sh "echo Running Code Quality Report analysis"
       sh "mvn clean sonar:sonar"
     }
  else if ("${stageName}" == "Upload Into Nexus") .. if we hv 10 commands to run then ders no nid for that , just upload into nexus is fine.
     {
       sh "mvn clean deploy"
     }
}

42;11 Jenkinsfile  .. starts with 
//@Library('LibraryName') _ 
we are creating a  // Declarative pipeline

}            46:35 *our lib does nt include the stage for git pull,, it starts with doing a build ...etc ie the common stages so in my pipeline script am doing a gitpull
}
stage("Build"){ 
  steps{
    common("Build") ### we can run sh "mvn clean package" bt i dnt wnt to use the trad option, i wnt to use my shared lib, wich hv some common steps, rather ill call a function
                    i hv a file called common.groovy, i wnt to call d function, so am calling d build stage of the function which makes it easy bc  a step can hv up to 10 commands 52:50
                                            
}
}

stage("Execute SonarQube Report"){ 
  steps{
    common("SonarQube Report") ##1:01 our steps is indicating common bc i am using the common.groovy file in my shared lib, if i was using stages.groovy then it il indicate stages

so far we v seen java applications wich we call java projects
also we v nodejs application which we call nodejs projects 

the main dif btw java appl and nodejs appl   bc nodejs appl is very key when it commes to my resume

java applications -- java projects 

nodejs applications:  nodeJS Projects
=======================================
npm = node package manager 
the command to do a build wit nodejs appl is npm   when ur tryin to build an appl that is written in nodejs we nid a npm, when doing a build with nodejs appl we use package.json
nodejs-APP   vs   java-app
--------           -------
npm =             maven/graddle   -->   Build
package.json      pom.xml -->   Build Script           
npm install       mvn package =  (creating packages) we do a build by creating packages
npm test          mvn test      =   run unit test cases 
npm run sonar     mvn sonar:sonar =  SonarQube CodeQualityReport
npm publish       mvn deploy       =  uploading artifacts
npm = node package manager 
  src + bs + test cases 

we ar doing a pipeline project for this nodejs appl , we ar writng a simple scripted pipeline script
1:09 ## new item- pipeline-ok - copy the pipeline script and paste in jenkins then build
 sudo yum install nodejs npm -y 

the first stage is called codecheckout 
node{
  stage('CodeCheckout'){                  
    sh "echo running ebay nodeJS project"     ###1:11:00 echo shud start wit sh, all the command shud follow a shell
    git 'https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/nodejs-application'    ## we nid the code from github so copy the github project repo (url) for nodejs url
                                                   its a pulic repo so no nid for cred, cloning directly frm master branch
  }
  stage('UnitTest'){   1:16:30     ####  its possible we had a unit test stage b4 the build stage. bt it failed bc no test to apply so we can comment the command
    //sh "npm test"             #sh "echo tests successful" alos if u try to connect to nexus/sonarqube n it fails jst comment on the command 
  }
  stage('Build'){             #### after the code is clone we'l do a build ,, sh "npm install" we are using node package manager to do a build bt b4 a build is done we nid
                                                        to install nodejs in jenkins sudo yum install nodejs npm -y 1:14:05, then paste pipeline script in jenkins n build
    sh "echo creating build artifacts"       
    nodejs(nodeJSInstallationName: 'nodejs17') { 
        sh 'npm install'
    }
  }
  stage('Quality'){    1:30 ## we ar executing sonarqube report for a nodejs appl
    sh "echo CodeQualityReport"
    nodejs(nodeJSInstallationName: 'nodejs17') {   ##1:20 to use the latest version of nodejs ill configure npm in jenkins -mange jenkins- global conf tools -if nodejs
        sh 'npm run sonar'         is nt der then install it in plugin -add: name &save. with this command we ar goin to buid using the latest vers or d ver we wnt to 2 use
    }                     ## 1:26 to execute sonarqube report, bc its nt a java project we dnt use pom.xml, we hv a file called sonar-project js, its the file we nid to config
  }                         and insert my sonarqube server url in serverurl, then for login,we use token- in sonarqube-adminstration-security-users-in administartor:create
    stage('UploadArtifacts'){                           ## a token : name;nodejs- genaterate- copy n paste in sonar-project js ,, i dnt nid a username, copy d stage for sonarqube
    sh "echo npm packages uploaded"                        & paste in jenkins save n build now then we can check in sonarqube for the report
    nodejs(nodeJSInstallationName: 'nodejs17') {  
        //sh 'npm publish'
        // Jenkins nexus intergration                   ###nexus default username is admin 
        // password = admin123  username = admin       ###1:35:20  Jenkins nexus intergration, for jenkins to talk to nexus, jenkins has to be authenticated, so we create           
        // echo -n 'admin:admin123' | openssl base64       artifactory resp in nexus. . in nexus we create npm hosted repo, name:ebay-npm-repo, copy n paste in package.json
    }                                                       -pubicconfig:registry.  nxt create a token in a file for admin pW & username using base64 SW. for soanrqube, we 
  }                      encrypted our PW & For nexus using base64 ill encrypt my username &PW &PIPE It  echo -n 'admin:admin123' | openssl base64, run it in jenkins then cop
  stage('deployment'){                        the code &paste in the file called npmrc: _auth=YWRtaW46YWRtaW4xMjM=  1:42:16 ,,,u dnt enter confidential info in github
     sh "echo Deploying applications"                 allowrepublish =true, always auth=true, then save   then copy this stage, paste in genkins &build now
    nodejs(nodeJSInstallationName: 'nodejs17') {          1:41:25 if u go thru d not
        sh 'npm start'
    }
  }                                         1:47:20 #### for deployment ill do npm start, here we used d build server for deployment, we didnt deploy to tomcat bt in docker&
}                                        kubernetes, we'l revisit dis project bc we hv dis same project then we'l b deploying it as docker containers , we'l see hw to deploy
                    nodejs appl    .. now we can see nodejs is running,we can access dis appl, http://localhost:9981/landmarktechnologies, its givin me local host bt am 
                                              assessing this appl on my jenkins server so for me to access this appl ill use my jenkins server url am nt using local host
                                     i copy the url and paste in the browser http://18.212.53.48:9981/landmarktechnologies


this appl has a port number bt this appl has some rest API  ,, application programming interface
RESTFUL API = 

http://18.212.53.48:9981/landmarktechnologies  .. this is one of them,, so am i able to access dis end point, yes so if dis API was like an info u wanted to get u shud b able 
http://18.212.53.48:9981/jsonData                                to access it.....1:52:00 we can go bk to our appl in github and see hw many APIs we hv,, so in app.js we hv-
http://18.212.53.48:9981/html                                     app.get/html, jsonData, redirect, queryparam
http://18.212.53.48:9981/redirect                   1:52:50  this is the link to d appl, the port number is 9981, redirect will redirect traffic to mylandmaktech.com website
http://18.212.53.48:9981/queryparam  .. dis showed undefine

           ####1:55:19   we hv a docker file, if we ar deploying dis appl as a docker container the port number is 9981, developers hv exposed dis appl on dis port, dats why
   when we ar trying to access dis appl everytin has a port number then a context path , all of this are what we call rest APIs

applications:
  High availabilit
####1:56:00 when u v an appl like dis 2tins is going to happen , as a devops engr ur function is to mk sure that this appli is highly available, therefore all of this API shud
be accessible, this cud be info abt cx account, in the video he'l share wit us we'l see hw to use new relic to create monitoring dashboard 1:57:30 e.g of new relic dashboard
online, a dashboard wit series of graphs showing u hw available ur appl is,  showing u hw many pipo ar able to access ur appl, the number of rEQ, hw cx are accessing their 
bank account in the bank , in real time u wnt be coming to click all of dis to find out if they are availabl or nt bc one appl can hv like 50 rest APIs, meaning der are more than 
50 stuff u can access like resource so u can make some API curves, so hw do u ensure that they ar available, we'l b using monitoring tools.. this is the end to end expectation
for jenkins..
