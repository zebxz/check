Thank you again for this question, am always very exicted to present myself as n engr
i hv over 10 yrs experience working in IT and over 7yrs majoring on devops and cloud computing , manging applications, securing applications and ensuring that applications are
accessible by endusers with relative ease, thats what hv been involved in

and go further to through some light on some of the technologies that you have used 

in realisng my job, hv used diff technology, diff tools, and diff software, diff technologies  to be able to realise the type of projects that i and am team offer to our clients
and that includes, using the linux infrastructure and also aoutomation tools like jenkins, and with the help of jenkins, we hv a project we call in our env jenkins k8 
integration, this is a very key project bc with this project as i said i work in a team, am in a team of abt 15persons, we hv developers, qa , DEVOPS engrs that are part of 
the team and what happens is that we hv devlopers constantly developing the appl and onec the appl is developed, new version of the appl are constantly been realised and whenevr
tehrs a new realised we ensure its immediately tajen to the cx and this is done by the help of the jenkins git and github integration where jenkins and github hv been configured
to be able to automate the realisation of most of this processes such that when thers a new commit in git, jenkins will automaitclly pull the new version of the code and a 
build will be triggered
