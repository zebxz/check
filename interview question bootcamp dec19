he said you should answer the question using landmark morning devotion template

33:50 
Thank you again for this question, am always very exicted to present myself as n engr
i hv over 10 yrs experience working in IT and over 7yrs majoring on devops and cloud computing , manging applications, securing applications and ensuring that applications are
accessible by endusers with relative ease, thats what hv been involved in

and go further to through some light on some of the technologies that you have used 

in realisng my job, hv used diff technology, diff tools, and diff software, diff technologies  to be able to realise the type of projects that i and am team offer to our clients
and that includes, using the linux infrastructure and also aoutomation tools like jenkins, and with the help of jenkins, we hv a project we call in our env jenkins k8 
integration, this is a very key project bc with this project as i said i work in a team, am in a team of abt 15persons, we hv developers, qa , DEVOPS engrs that are part of 
the team and what happens is that we hv devlopers constantly developing the appl and onec the appl is developed, new version of the appl are constantly been realised and whenevr
tehrs a new realised we ensure its immediately tajen to the cx and this is done by the help of the jenkins git and github integration where jenkins and github hv been configured
to be able to automate the realisation of most of this processes such that when thers a new commit in git, jenkins will automaitclly pull the new version of the code and a 
build will be triggered

its a generic diagram, and its something u shud be able to explain over time 
this is morning devotion apparently, devops automation video

****** explaning the diagram


and again it is worth mentioning here that we work on java projects and as a result ill talk more on the java based tool that we are using eg,once jenkins pulls the latest
version of the  appl, jenkins is immediatellly connecting with maven and once that happens maven and maven is able to do a build
it is worth mentioning that our maven env is configured such that our depencies of our project is securly obtained for the project to executed and as such we hv configured
maven as a slave to jekins , so in our mavne jenkins env, maven is a slave, maven been a slave we hv equally ensure dthat all the project depencies neeede for maven to do 
a build a gotten via a proxy repository meaning our build server doesnt go to the internet to directly get depencies and pluggin to do a build and the reason is bc in env
security is inherent so its very imp to mention that
also when maven is foing a build, ther are some things maven is looking at ,bc we execute the mvn package goal, in this goal maven will first validate the file structure and 
the code that ensure that devlopers hv done a great job in presentation of the project ,maven will equally compile the java classics and this classic will be converting/combining
java code in bycode that the java virtual machine can easily understand so compilation goes into effect and it is worth mentioning that once that takes place successfully, unit
test cases are bein run and if the test gives us a pass then maven will do a build.

so this is all about maven and what maven helps us to ahieve in our automated pipeline jobs

once artifacts are created, our major conecrn is to ensure that our clients are satisfied, so in our env we are very keen abt quality
we hv a tool we use for code quality called sonarqube and in sonarqube we hv created a bench mark for all our project which states that code coverage for eg  must be atleast
99% bc the appl we manage are fintech appl and we dnt make provison for any type of failure so we hv code coverage and we equally ensure that we dnt hv code smell in our 
benchmark, we ensure that our duplictaions, duplicate lines is less than 5%, so ll of that has been setup as a benchmark when it comes to code quality, so we hv used quality
gate snad profiles to create our baenchmark so once sonarqube runs sonaqube analysis, sonarqube is actually comapring actual result frm standared/expected result 
so if the actual result is as expectd which imples that code coverage for eg execeds 90% it means that the software devloped by developers has met a cerstain minmum 
quality xpectation and once that happens we are goin to proceed bt if it fails then our pipeline breaks at that point and an email will be forwarded to developers informing 
them of the problem that occurred and it shud be resolved b4 we can proceed

but if the code quality was successful, this meeans we hv met our quality benchmark and we are ready to deploy our appl to the lcient env bt b4 this deployment takes place
ther aer a few things that we always consider :
the first , we need to ensure that our artifacts/ deployable pacakages are well manged and backedup so we upload into a distribution mgt env , into an artifactoyr called
nexus , so we use nexus as our artifactory repository and once that happens we are now ready for deplyment 
so first we deploy our appl to a test env , in this env  what are we checking, we are ensuring that this appl works as expected and meets the general threshold, so we firts 
deploy in the user testing env once the appl works effectively and we are sactified then our pipeline will trigger a production env deployment and for appl to be deployed in 
the prod env, ther a few factors that are considered:
additional testing is perfromed in the test env like perforamnce tesing, security testing, penetration testing, regression testing after all this and we are sure, now our 
client will hv to agrree that this is what they expect from us so they sign a white document agreeing to the performance of the apppl and onec that is doen we now deploy
the appl to the client env and in deploying this appl we ensure that the client env is secured enough

so this is the  end to end deployment of our appl, when it comes to deplyment
so this is what happens in rela time

this is another explanation i did in class34

where is deployment taking place
we see deployment is taking place in UAT , UAT deploymentin this env
