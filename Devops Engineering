LSS (Landmark software solutions) approached by company telsa
to manage their application and develop a software

WAYS SUCH TASKS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE PAST 
1)Waterfall approach
2) Agile
3) Devops


LSS    *******   WATER FALL METHODOLOGY     (TELSA)
start by gtahering requirements - mr Telsa what do you want us to do for you? 

1)Requirements gathered by teamleads/Architect
high level documentation - system requirments
e.g what type of computers do you they need

2) desing - to design it - HLD/ SRS
3)Then development - the developers and software (sE ) ENGINEERS 
4)Testing - (QA) Qualty assurance
5) MAintenence stage - (support team) maake sure product is functioning aas expected , ensure product meets clients needs


LIMITATIONS
1) Poor time mgt: e.g project can be carrie dout in 4monthsbut if thers a problem, we have to carry out the entire process again
2)poor resource utilization: e.g when maintenance team is working other depts are idle , when testing is taking place developers are idle

AGILE METHODOLOGY : Scrum framework
we will have iterations/ sprints: repreents a dev cycle or unit
therfore we will hv diff sprint e.g sprint1, sprint2,  which will represent a dev cycle 
a sprint can last for 10 working days (10 WD)
what we will do in esch team will depend on our team composition/capacity

eg  sprint1 = 8 features              sprint2 = 6features
4 developers                               3 developers
2 QA                                        2 QA
3 scrum masters                              2 SCRUM masters
2 system administartion                      2 system administrators

ADVANTAGES
Agile approach is very good bc it makes use of meetings - sprint planing meeting , sprint restrospect, i5 mins daily standups. - before a sprint starts in the meetings tasks
will be assigned and evelautions regarging the outcome of the assignmets 
thers continous follow up to ensure our goals are achieved
restrospects : questions like what did we do well , what could be done better

LIMITATIONS
Team high velocity:  sprint 1 had 8 features but sprint2 could dev 6features bc of fewre team members
