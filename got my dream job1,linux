    LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD



LANDMARK  DEVOPS E. DEgree master class syllabus: 
 for everyone to becomae a master and to master the subject matter in Devops end to end automation and deployment.

   AFTER Devops training you are expected to become 
1)SME = subject matter expert
it means that you have - Technical skill - understanding all the devops modules
2) mangerial skill - Project mangers (mange projects, members in your team) - scrum master
3) leadership skills - can be a team lead
SRE : site reliability engineering
DevSecops : Devops dev security and operations 
   SRE/DevSecops
Devops/cloud/Application Engineering
platform/kubernetes/application Engineering/ infrastructure engineering

DEVOPS INTRO:
we are devops engr , we are subject matter experts 

Applications are the output from software

Anything done in linux is a process 


What is your Technology stack in landmark Technologies  ?/??
   in other words, what are the tools that are in your tool box?
These tools are what we can call the modules for this class
In our technology stack we are talking about computerized automated technologies
and the task are executed either using GUI or CLI

Tasks like; File mgt, user mgt, system mgt

Linux 3 , 3:15:
As a devops engr, i work with my team to :
develop Applications
test    Applications
Build    Applications
Review    Applications
Secure     Applications
Deploy      Applications
Access      Applications
Maintain     Applications
Manage & Monitor 
using computerized automated technologies


***** Git4  ... 15.26 
the recommendation is to write good commit messages

we support java based applictaion/projects in our environment


Anytime we change anything tin in configurtaion file we restart the server


Sonar Q&A
we cant do without CLI bc commands bring automation thats why you hv so much money thrown at you  and its not in all cases that we can  use only GUI

what is sshd  ???
i knw we need a service smt when we are connecting to server and you always say ssh , pls what ais ssh to a layman  ?????????
..... i think it means we connect



******************************************************************

 WHAT KIND OF COMPUTER ARE YOU USING ??
The type of computer one is using can depend on the vendor
eg : i can say am using a dell computer but its running a windows system so am using a windows computer

therfore, what makes a computer isnt just about the hardware or vendor but mostly about the operating system running the computer
the heart of the computer is the operating system

An HP with windows operating system = windows system 
A dell laptop with linux operating system = linux systems
An HP laptop with linux operating system = linux system

i have experience in implememnting devops processes and automaitng tasks for multiple clients


******* devops brings automation therefore, devops is all about automation because on a daily basis we are trying to automate it tasks and process .
what we have automated we are asking are there better automation options 
e.g, if our current automation takes 10hours, our question eveyday is can we automate better to reduce the time from 10 to 2hours



WHAT IS DEVOPS TO YOU   .. ?
Based on my experience devops is all abt continous automation and improvement on how IT tasks and processes are implemented

WHY devops ?
1) continous Automation -:
Devops brings automation, continous and thats why we choose devops in our env. We choose devops not agile or waterfall or a combination of Agile 
and devops bc devops brings continous automation

2) Continous transformation: 
transforming how things are done 

3) Disruption:
changing how task were done in the past , disrupt processes that were done using traditional approasch , bring in automation 
4)its all about innovation and change


     DEVOPS IMPORTANCE?
its the present and the future of IT innovation (and change) The way devops is devops is designed and implementated is whats needed today which is the present and thats what
will be needed tommorrow meaning devops is the future bc it brings continous automation 


   WHAT IS YOUR TASK AS A DEVOPS ENGINEER ?
As a devops engineer, i work with my team to develop, test, build, review + qualify , secure, deploy , access, maintain and monitor applications using computerized

(COMPUTER SYSTEM), HOW ARE TASKS EXECUTED/PERFORMED ON A COMPUTER SYSTEM,  LINUX OS AND LINUX COMMANDS: Mobaxterm, HOW CAN SOFTWARES BE PROVIDED,  CREATING AN ACCOUNT IN AWS & LAUNCHING 
A SERVER 


linux 1 
 **** to create and connect to server, check end of linux1 & begining of linux2 note

Linux 
pre requisite softwares
SSH - SECURE SHELL
  These are some of the softwares to download
  1) mobaxterm X server with SSH, Telnet, RDP, VNC and X11

iii) Gitbash and powershell


                              LINUX
            WHAT IS A COMPUTER ?
a computer is an electronic device that can store, process and display information
Its a device with both hard and software component sused to run task and processes
computer hardware: comes with modarboard, keyboard, RAM, mouse, harddrive, CPU, cards, screen/monitor etc

 SOFTWARE COMPONENTS
1) OS- Operating system which is the heart of a computer 
2) other softwares: microsoft office, adobe reader, antivirus , sublime etc

   VENDORS /MANUFACTURERS
Lenovo/dell/hp/apple/Acer/asus/toshiba


     CLASSIFCATION OF COMPUTER  
Personal computers:
Desktop, laptop,/ipad/ tables/ phones/notebook/watches etc 


    ENTERPRISE COMPUTERS
workstation, servers (super computer)


The operating system running in a computer defines the computer type
OP - os 
windows os
linux os
solars os
mac os
ios os
android smartphones (smasung motorola)
if a lenovo laptop is running linux os = linux system
hp laptop is running with solar os - sloars system
dell ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, windows os - windows system

WHAT DETERMINES THE CHOICE OF AN OS (COMPUTER SYSTEM)
1) SECURITY:
85% OF our servers are linux based
linux systems are not vulnerable to virux attack
windows systems are vulnerable to virus attack

eg youare exempted/free from sickness
be sick and get treated

2) cost 
linus is a freee and open source OS
windows is a lincenced and paid OS

3) support 
linux has a very large effective and free community support (200m people)
windows support is available only from microsoft (100m people) but paid 
eg   1m possible helpers to resolve my issue for free
      1k possible helpers to resolve my issue at a cost


4) usage
linux oS mostly utilized for enterprise tasks eg creating servers
windows is mostly utilized as a workstation

5)performance
6) Reviews
7) speed
8) scalability and elasticity - ie can it be scaled ?


HOW ARE TASKS EXECUTED/PERFORMED ON A COMPUTER SYSTEM
1) gui CONSOLE: Graphic user interface
         graphic user - 2hours
       25000 UI ---- 65k usd per 
2) CLI - command line interface (accomplish task faster)
         command user  --5 min
    Engineers/administartors -120k - 400k per yr
powershell
gtbash
terminal - mac OS

using CLI we can use gitbash and perform task faster than GUI

LINUX OS AND LINUX COMMANDS: Mobaxterm
linux is an open source operating system
linux started around 1991 by linus torlvads


linus was using a solar system for his project when he ecountered a problem while running his project, he tried seeeking help but the vendor for the solars must be contacted
for help so he decided to create something else that can be easily for help and for free

working on his project using a solar system, linus created the linus OS from the solars kernel/os 
linux is an open source OS with multiple distributors and or versions
windows, solars, MacOS, etc are licenced OS 


      HOW CAN SOFTWARES BE PROVIDED?
SOFTWARES can be provided as??
1)open source software (free with the source code) 
open source softwares has more community support

2) free softwares:
free but without the source code  (recipe) 

3) lincenced softwares: (paid for windows os, office 365


FOLLOWING ARE THE LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS :
1) Redhat linux  2) Centos linux   3) Ubuntu linux  4) Suse linux 5) Fedora linux
6) Gentoo linux  7) mandriva linux 8) Debian linux  9) slackware  10) Amazon linux 2AMI 
11) faule - linux, landmark linux



 EXPLAIN YOUR EXPERIENCE IN OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGY
Linux with open source technologies the software is free
including the source code (recipe/secrets of the biz)

LINUX COMMANDS, FILE MGT RELATED TASKS( LINUX FILE STRUCTURE), ROOT DIR (/),(home contains home dir details of that user eg we hv home dir of the root user,
home dir of ec2user (default user ie created by the sys) and home dir of any other user that we create) CONTENT OF ROOT DIR;BIN,SBIN (excuted by users with priviledge),diff users in linux
CONFIGURATION FILE,LINUX BASIC COMMANDS, HOW TO RUN TASK IN LINUX SYSTEMS(cli,gui,script)
TYPES OF TASKS (FILE MGT:dir mgt command , install command not found ;INSTALL TREE, CREATING DIR, sudo, cd ; forward and backward move, create hidden file, how to run task in linux )
        (other tasks we will explore are: Task like; user mgt, system mgt,process mgt, security mgt, package mgt, serveice mgt, monitoring)
 


     LINUX COMMANDS
WhAt can be done on my server after accessing it 

1)file management in linux, we have to look at the file structure, the nomeclature, how it is being named 
file mgt releted tasks:

How are files Called in linux        
Windows                                            linux/mac
files                                                files
folder /foldes                                   directory/directories (container of files)
Sub-folders                                           sub - directories


root dIRECTORY: the root directory created when you launch a windows system it starts from C:\
ROOT DIR for linux is - forward /               ( / this is root dir, its root env owned by root  , cd /, trying to get into root user

the root directory [/] is the main principal dir where other directories and sub-directories are created from 

COMMANDS:
sudo - to create a new user
Ls -a = list directory content with files and & dir 
starting with . ie including (hidden)files   ********* i added this hidded when i was making the summarized notes
                                                           
commands : ls dir name =  eg ls pwd                                          ls/filename1/file inside file1
ls = list the content of a directory = list the content of your pwd eg ls OR ls /home/ec2-user  ... BC /home/ec2user is my pwd
pwd = present working directory
hostname = serverName
cd = change directory
commands to change hostname : sudo hostnamectl set-hostname demo
                                sudo su - ec2-user
sudo su - user = to switch user


root directory 
[root -user@demo ~ ] ls       ***** checking for files in the home dir
[root -user@demo ~ ]............ we get  nothing bc we dnt hv any files (yet)in the home dir, i added yet while makin summary note
[root -user@demo ~ ] ls /      ie to list the content of the root dir
bin home media  root sys
boot lib mnt run tmp
dev lib64 opt sbin usr
etc local proc  siv var

                                            HOME; contains users' home directory details 
home contains user home directory information eg
when we check
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls/home 
ec2-user
ec2-user [a user created by the system}
lets add user domi(sudo add user domi) 
lets add user obi (sudo adduser obi) 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo adduser obi
[ec2-user@demo~] $
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls/home 
ec2-user domi obi


bin contains binary files (commands)
cat fileName: used to read the content of a file
ls, pwd, clear, cd, touch (to create a new file)    eg  touch test.txt
cat -n filename
******30:18
i just did adduser paul and paul was created

                                              SBIN 
we also hv system binary files ,can only be executed by user with admin priviledges ,the admin-user/or the root user/administrator 
sbin: contains system binary files/commands
eg of system binary files : 
adduser, to add user
passwd, : can be used to assign passwd to users
chage, used to modify users expiry date 
chown  change own 

we aslo hv the etc dir 
also var dir 

****** administrator is called root user

************************************  in performing task in linux, there are diff category of users



we can cat to check the content of etc/shadow ie info abt the passwd of user
[root@demo~] # cat/etc/shadow 

etc : contains configuration files
/etc/shadow = detail information about users passwd
/etc/passwd = detail inf abt users                         ****** contains file of all users
/etc/ssh/sshd_config = ssh configuration details
   ssh=secure shell
sshd = ssh service/ daemon = user Name/passwd    eg to access your server via ssh you need username/passwd OR username & ssh key
UserName/ssh -private-key

- tmp: temporal files
-opt: directory where softwares & packages should be installed, it is the best place to install 
- var: var directory contains dynamic files
eg /var/logs/messages

-pro directory: Contains inf about the hardware (hardware info)
eg mem info - memory information
cpu info  - cpu information
ï¼»root@demo-# cat/proc/meminfo = to check for info about my memory


                                                               LINUX 3a

ie it lists the content of our pwd



              Deleting file (with or without content)
rm filename

 online
To remove a directory using the rm command in Linux, follow these steps:
1) rmdir dirname           :  to delete an empty dir 
2) rm:                     :  to delete empty and non-empty directories
  a) rm -r dirname         :  If a directory or a file within the directory is write-protected, you will be prompted to confirm the deletion
  b) rm -rf                :  To remove a directory without being prompted
  c) rm -r dir1 dir2 dir3  :   To remove multiple directories at once, with a prompt to confirm
  d) rm -rI dir1           :  To remove multiple directories without a prompt
  e) rm -rv directory_name :  To see a list of deleted files


**********                      counting line and character in a file 
wc fileanme = in the order of lines/words/character

                  RESOURCE ULTILIZATION
sOft link is more resource efficient bc it uses minimal resources of our system 
soft link points to our original file/doc but hard link is a copy of the file 

while the original file is deleted, we cannot access the original link frm the soft link bc its a symbol to the file but we can access the original file form the hard copy
bc its a copy of the original file 


   CREATIG SHORTCUT /LINK TO FILES
Hard link : copy of a file (hard link starts with '_') just like a normal file 
ln fieName linkName
ln list.txt my list
hardlink maintains original file size  eg if original file size is 250, hardlink will also be 250


softlink: symbolic to the file ) short cut link to the file
ln-s filename linkname
ln -s new.txt mylist
*** soft link starts with  l & the file size is smaller compared to the original file 
eg, original file can be 250mb in size but softlink can be 5mb in size

system mgt commands, Date, set, show, check ,change hostname,change date, ping server, check if server is runing, diff ways to connect to server, how to know who is connected to my server , 
package mgt, service names, process mgt, process mgt

 how to mg8 your system
To know your ip adress ; copy & paste in your browser.....  https:whatismyipaddress.com

curl ifconfig.me  = list the publicIP address

1)date : Print or set the system date and time
      date -S "ddmmyyy Time"

  2)sudo timedatectl set-timezone 'America/New_York
df : Report file system disk space usage
   df -h    how much space are files ultilizing 

3)hostname; sudo hostname newHostname    = set a Temporal/current-session new hostname 
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newHostname - set a permanent new hostname

4)hostname -i = list your privateIP address  
5)If server is working; Ping hostname OR ping Ip address 
ping localhost
ip a     = list the privateIP address including network interfaces

6)   DIFF WAYS TO CONNECT TO SERVER
1) USING the hostname - ssh ec2-user@ demo33
2) using public ip address-ec2-user@40.208.35.48
3) using private ip address -112.31.84.211

7)who  = list the users connected to the server and from where and since when    
w  = list the users connected to the server 
     and their idle time including load average/uptime     

uptime= shows how long a system has been running/has ran without shutting down 
           (higher uptime hsows better performance of system)

users = how many users are connected

load avarage: 0.90, OR 0.80 OR 0.94 , shows that we have to check the system very well bc the system resource is over utilized and the system is running on very minimal 
resources

whoami  
whereis  
curl ifconfig.me  = list the publicIP address



packageMGT, processMGT and ServiceMGT commands:
================================================



  PACKAGE MGT

Package managers come in two main categories: dependency managers and operating system package managers.
 1)Dependency managers, like Maven, npm, and Gradle, handle project-specific dependencies and their versions for programming languages and frameworks.
2)Operating system package managers, such as apt, yum,& Homebrew, manage software and system packages for specific operating systems. eg Linux, MAcOs, Windows

System packages are collections of software, documentation, and configuration files that are bundled together to make it easier to install, manage, and utilize a specific software program
or application. Examples include software suites like Microsoft Office, which includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Other examples include web browsers like Chrome, and Firefox, and 
operating systems like Windows. 
    

                                 PACKAGE MANAGEMENT COMMAND
 How to install, updates and remove packages in redhat linux 

************ y is only associated with package command , it doesnt apply to any other process or command 

sudo yum insatll, wget -y  -- to install
sudo yum remove wget -y    ---  to delete
 sudo yum install httpd -y


wget helps to download (software appl/packages)but 
package managers download and install sofware & system packages

webget: wget is a non-interactive netwrk downloaader used to download (software)packages 
                        eg, download the tomcat9 websserver/java application/software package
wget|httpds://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/9.0.78/bin/apache

***** so long as wget is already installed, it can be used to download packages with the download link
wget can be used to download software packages for our server

**** To Install Wget : sudo yum install wget -y  
     https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.78/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.78.zip
Using Wget to install tomcat package : wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.78/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.78.zip          



USING PACKAGE MANAGERS
apt install packageName- debian/ubuntu systems
brew install packageName - Mac - APPLe systems
choco install packageName - windows systems
yum install packageName - good for redhat/contos systems

dnf install chrony
    yum install chrony


SERVICE NAMES
httpd
sshd
ntpd


  processMGT commands:
===================

processMGT                            ********** what ever happens in linux is a command 
    ps -ef | grep httpd  
    ps -ef | grep sshd  
    ps -ef | grep ntpd 

ps    - to list the process
  ps -ef  - list all the processes running
    ps -ef | grep httpd    - grep for apache service   (to show apache is running 
    ps -ef | grep sshd      - shows process ids (all those that are using the same service
  top        -    tells the number of processes running 
  
  You observed that a process  is consuming over 90% of cpu/memory, what action 
  should you take ?
  kill the process with  
    kill -9 processID  

the parent process
the child process

    ProcessMGT = top, ps -ef, jobs, kill, bg, fg

                                                          TEE COMMAND
tee:  This command is used to store and view the
     the output of any other command.
     (both at the same time)     

echo "I am the finest Engineer"

[obi@demo33 ~]$ echo "Landmark Engineers are the best in 2023" > best
result ...send ..  landmark engineers are the best into the file without displaying 

BUT:
[obi@demo33 ~]$ echo "Landmark Engineers are the best in 2023" | tee best
Landmark Engineers are the best in 2023     .... (the input is stored and displayed at the same time)
[obi@demo33 ~]$ tail -5  /etc/passwd > newusers
[obi@demo33 ~]$
[obi@demo33 ~]$ cat newusers
paul:x:1003:1003::/home/paul:/bin/bash

legah:x:1006:1006::/home/legah:/bin/bash
apache:x:48:48:Apache:/usr/share/httpd:/sbin/nologin
nginx:x:992:992:Nginx web server:/var/lib/nginx:/sbin/nologin


******** 
tail -5 /etc/passwd | tee new.txt  

result:
  it created the file new.txt and directs the tail info into it and displays the info as well


      PING

ping: The ping command sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts.
      This verify if the host is alive 
   ping localhost  = check if your local system is alive/running   
   ping landmark.cm  
   ping mylandmarktech.com                **** you are working for a coy and a cx calls and says the website is nt working, you can ping the website 
   ping google.com  

                                          TELNET
                      To check if a particular is running or not
telnet: 
for any computer or system;    a server/system/computer have 0-65535(65536) ports/addresses  
0-65535, ie port range
(65536 , ie no. of port or addresses

    ssh   = 22,  http  = 80,  https = 443

 telnet 172.31.31.46 22 
  telnet 172.31.31.46 80  
   telnet 172.31.31.46 443 
    telnet 172.31.31.46 3389   
       telnet landmark.cm 80 
   telnet mylandmarktech.com 8080 
   telnet google.com 80    


  STEP1: 
check for ip addresses = hostname -i
next 
telnet ip address portnumber

uname: describes your system  
   uname -a 
   cat /etc/*release
   cat /etc/*os*


[obi@demo33 ~]$ cat /etc/*release
Amazon Linux release 2023 (Amazon Linux)
NAME="Amazon Linux" , VERSION="2023" , ID="amzn", ID_LIKE="fedora", VERSION_ID="2023", PLATFORM_ID="platform:al2023", PRETTY_NAME="Amazon Linux 2023", ANSI_COLOR="0;33"
CPE_NAME="cpe:2.3:o:amazon:amazon_linux:2023",  HOME_URL="https://aws.amazon.com/linux/", BUG_REPORT_URL="https://github.com/amazonlinux/amazon-linux-2023", SUPPORT_END="2028-03-01"
Amazon Linux release 2023 (Amazon Linux)

                        
                             tunlp
checks available addresses and addresses that are in use 

netstat -tunlp:
  a server/system/computer have 0-65535(65536) ports/addresses 
we have address:  server ports/address = 22/80/443/etc  
  tomcat requires to use port 8080 by default 
  sudo yum install tomcat  
  sudo systemctl start tomcat   

  nginx uses port 80 by default
    sudo yum install nginx  
    sudo systemctl start nginx   
  http server also uses port 80 by default 
    sudo yum install httpd  
    sudo systemctl start httpd   


**** therfore if port 8080 isnt available, tomcat wont install because it requires port 8080 by default for it to install
      
To insstall:  sudo yum -y install net-tools
netstat -tunlp
  t = tcp,  u = udp,  l = listening, p = port, n = number  : 
netstat -tulpn  


its important to know there are some ports to watch out for 

 protocols        ports/address    
   ssh              22  
   http             80  
   https            443  
   nfs              2089  
   rdp              3389  
   smtp          25/465/587         .....  (simple mail transfer protocol) 
   tomcat           8080 --- 8000  
   jenkins          8080      

****** THERFORE, for tomcat to run, we have to change the port address of one of them

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

          Summarized for interview
Explain your experience with linux system/EXPLAIN YOUR EXPERIENCE IN OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGY
Linux with open source technologies the software is free, including the source code,85% OF our servers are linux based,linux systems are not vulnerable to virux attack, our linux servers are scalable & linux has a very large effective and free community support
LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS 
1) Redhat linux  2) Centos linux   3) Ubuntu linux  4) Suse linux 5) Fedora linux
6) Gentoo linux  7) mandriva linux 8) Debian linux  9) slackware  10) Amazon linux 2AMI 
i have over 7years experience performing various tasks on linux system including:
1) Deploying, provisioning and creating linux servers in Aws cloud and connecting to servers using - ssh protocol
2) configuring , optimising , commissioning (installing packages) and decommissioning (uninstalling packages)and securing linux servers
3) Running workloads in linux servers/systems using:
GUI - console
command - CLI
scripts -  *** mee   (which i will expand on when we get to tools like ;docker, ansible & terrafrom)


EXamples of workoads/task i execute includes:

file mgt: touch ,    (created files, modified files, make direstories, granted persmission, ,....  File editor (windows) sublime text, vim, vscode, eclipse
user mgt: adduser, modify users, defining the scope of users privilidges, assigning paswd, change ownership, granting users permission
process mgt ; top, ps-ef, jobs, kill,bg, fg starting a process, stop/kill a process 
security mgt;  configuring passwd authentication, fierwall (to secure our severs)
package mgt ; installing, update softwares using package managers like yum,apt, rpm (redhat package manager)  ( brew for apple systems, yum for redhat, apt for ubuntu systems, choco for windows) 
service mgt ;  systemctl, start/stop/enable/status; , archive/data backup, tunlp;checks available ports/addresses and addresses that are in use, systemctl arguments serviceName; eg  systemctl start/stop/status httpd, uptime: Tells how long the system has been running
system mgt ;  change hostname,change date, ping server to check if server is runing
monitoring = monitor system responses and send alerts using the threshold everyminute if cpu/mem usage exceed 80%
4)scheduling and automating task using cron tables
a) backup all data bases every midnight
C) optimize our appservers every month on the 20th  day at midnight (yum update -y & $ yum upgrade -y)


FOR effective RESOURCE UTILIZATION, we utilize soft links bc it uses minimal resources of our system ...  (small l, hard link:-)
