can use the vscode with :
terraform
git
ansible
kubernetes 34:00
docker   34:40


35:20  ..............let me show uwhen using this atleat for functionalty
we hv our infrastructure in aws , mostly our servers in aws
so u can configure ur vs code so that u can do a remote development 
this means if i hv a server in aws then i want to merge with my anisible/terfrm server in aws bt i dnt want to use like mobaxtrem or gitbash to login intomthe server to 
start runing my command frm der, so i can configure my vscode so that i do a remote development, wherby i can see all my files, directries,users in the server in aws
in extension u need to install remote ssh and configure...
so open SSH configuration file ( i clicked on the remote window down on the screen , then frm d pop up window i clicked on  connect to host then C:User\macintosh\.ssh\config

38:14............................. watch


56:000 anoda tin u shud be aware of is wsl
bc vscode is a windows owned, maintained by microsoft , they equally hv this wsl, windows subsutebnce of linux, its prety gud
if u wnt to run ur linux command on ur windows, it offers a windows subsitence of linux, wher by u an create a windows substiting on ur windows
if u go to ur windows n type microsoft store, u can search for ubuntu, u can buy it, bt i think most of them are basically free
these are like linux subsistence bt they are managed by windows so wit that i hv dis ubuntu that is ruing on my windowss dstop, bc its compartible wiit vscode bc they are
all microsoft product so now hv config dis ubuntu, now once u run it i can run vscode frm wsl

58:00
in the ubuntu , he type code in the pwd and enter and it opened vscode , now its runing it in a linux substinece in ubutun, in wsl 
so for this wsl bc its local to my system , i am able to run linux commands locally , i am able  to do evrthin linux bc am using the wsl, as opposed to  if i do the remote
ssh then my server in aws will always hv to b runing for me to b able to do the dev her wih amy add up to d cost bc ur servers are suppos eto b runing bt if i use wsl this 
is local, i v configured it local, n i am able to run  all my linux command right here
bc its ubuntu am able ot install ansible, v installe ansible on my local env ,ubutu wich is my local env,  
so i can run my ansible command frm my local env bc i config ansible on this ubuntu n am able to create the yaml files, am able to run terfrm locally, with taht it 
makes it easier for me when am testing out, doing projects n i dnt want to b rruning cost in aws to v my servers in aws runing al the time, also i dnt wnt my ansible 
serevr or my contro mode to be on aws or in the cloud , wher by i wud hv to either keep it on so dat the i dnt hv to always change the ip address 
of my host in terms of i need to ssh  into it , like when i shut it down i nid to find the ip address  ,bt now i to config evrytin on my wsl using dynamic inventory config
every on my wsl, so now its just goin to search fo rmybservrs the serversvtaht are alive .

i v config my env bt dis is technically , i knw a lot of cy that use wsl in their env bc it gives u the flexoibility of running it frm ur windows , so this is 
smt u can also look into
  ***********************1:01     if u hv ur wslextension configured , u can equally go to the microsoft store  n download bc u nid to install dat syubsitence of linux that
u want  ... equally frm that u can check logs,  u can reopen folders  in wsl, open folders in windows, u can play arounfd with all this an find out hw it wrks
so far for me its been working well

     ****************** 1:3:00     .......... watch
like sharee    
 u writing ur code u need help , vscode provides that functionality wherby u can collaborate wit a friend , with a team , u are able to write the code togethrer
install the like share extension
