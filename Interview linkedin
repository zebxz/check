 CI/CD — What’s Actually Happening Behind the Scenes?

> When I first heard about CI/CD, I honestly thought it was just some fancy automation buzzword.

But after playing around with Jenkins and GitHub, I finally get it.

Here’s what really happens when you push your code 👇

🧩 Continuous Integration (CI):
Every time you commit code, Jenkins (or GitHub Actions) jumps in builds your project, runs tests, and checks if you accidentally broke something. Basically, your friendly robot tester 🤖

🚀 Continuous Deployment (CD):
Once everything passes, it automatically sends your updated code straight to the server (like AWS EC2 or Kubernetes). No manual steps. No “works on my machine” drama.

In short:
CI/CD = Code goes from laptop → production → live — automatically.

That’s the real DevOps magic ✨**

**********************************************************************************************



Muhammad Ilya
Commonly asked questions on Terraform in an Interview

🧩 1️⃣ What is a Terraform State File?
The terraform.tfstate file is the source of truth for your infrastructure.
 It maps your Terraform configuration to real-world resources.
💡 Tip: Store it remotely (S3, Azure Blob, Terraform Cloud) for team collaboration and state locking.

🔒 2️⃣ What Happens If You Lose the State File?
Terraform forgets what’s deployed — it might try to recreate everything 
✅ Always enable remote backends + versioning to recover easily.

⚙️ 3️⃣ What is Terraform Drift?
Drift happens when the actual infrastructure differs from what’s defined in your Terraform code.
Example: Someone modifies an EC2 instance directly in AWS Console.
💬 Command to detect: terraform plan

🔁 4️⃣ How Do You Fix Drift?
You can either:
* Update your Terraform configuration to match actual changes, or
* Run terraform apply to restore the desired state.

🌍 5️⃣ How to Handle Multiple Environments (Dev, Stage, Prod)?
Use Workspaces or separate state files/backends for each environment.
 This keeps your infra isolated, safe, and easier to manage.
