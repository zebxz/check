sudo - to create a new user
Ls -a = list directory content with files and & dir 
starting with . ie including (hidden)files   ********* i added this hidded when i was making the summarized notes


ls dir name =  eg ls pwd                                          ls/filename1/file inside file1
ls /      ie to list the content of the root dir
ls = list the content of a directory = list the content of your pwd eg ls OR ls /home/ec2-user  ... BC /home/ec2user is my pwd
pwd = present working directory
hostname = serverName
cd = change directory
commands to change hostname : sudo hostnamectl set-hostname demo
                                sudo su - ec2-user
sudo su - user = to switch user

 HOME; contains users' home directory details 
ls/home 


bin contains binary files (commands)
cat fileName: used to read the content of a file
ls, pwd, clear, cd, touch (to create a new file)    eg  touch test.txt
cat -n filename

we also hv system binary files ,can only be executed by user with admin priviledges ,the admin-user/or the root user/administrator 
sbin: contains system binary files/commands
eg of system binary files : 
adduser, to add user
passwd, : can be used to assign passwd to users
chage, used to modify users expiry date 
chown  change own 

we aslo hv the etc dir 
also var dir 


we can cat to check the content of etc/shadow ie info abt the passwd of user
[root@demo~] # cat/etc/shadow 

******* etc : contains configuration files
/etc/shadow = detail information about users passwd
/etc/passwd = detail inf abt users                         ****** contains file of all users
/etc/ssh/sshd_config = ssh configuration details
   ssh=secure shell
sshd = ssh service/ daemon = user Name/passwd    eg to access your server via ssh you need username/passwd OR username & ssh key
UserName/ssh -private-key

- tmp: temporal files
-opt: directory where softwares & packages should be installed, it is the best place to install 
- var: var directory contains dynamic files
eg /var/logs/messages

-pro directory: Contains inf about the hardware (hardware info)
eg mem info - memory information
cpu info  - cpu information
ï¼»root@demo-# cat/proc/meminfo = to check for info about my memory

To remove a directory using the rm command in Linux, follow these steps:
1) rmdir dirname           :  to delete an empty dir 
2) rm:                     :  to delete empty and non-empty directories
  a) rm -r dirname         :  If a directory or a file within the directory is write-protected, you will be prompted to confirm the deletion
  b) rm -rf                :  To remove a directory without being prompted
  c) rm -r dir1 dir2 dir3  :   To remove multiple directories at once, with a prompt to confirm
  d) rm -rI dir1           :  To remove multiple directories without a prompt
  e) rm -rv directory_name :  To see a list of deleted files

IQ: What is the umask value for a normal user and the rootUser?
IQ: What is the umask value?
    It is used to define file/dir Permissions at creation.  

            normal user        rootUser
            file     dir       file     dir  
 owner   = rw-=6    rwx=7      rw-=6    rwx=7   
 group   = rw-=6    rwx=7      r--=4    r-x=5
 others  = rw-=6    rwx=7      r--=4    r-x=5  



2)PERMISSON FOR ROOT USER:
   ( i bliv the root user always has the default permission)

switch to the rootUser:
  sudo su - or 
  sudo -i  
Make a file

d rwx r-x r-x. 2 root root 6 May  4 23:45 billionaire
- rw- r-- r--. 1 root root 0 May  4 23:45 rich.me

 rootUser
        file     dir  
       rw-=6    rwx=7   
       r--=4    r-x=5
       r--=4    r-x=5  

****** when a mask value is set, it is used to determine the type of permission the file will have 



3)what is umask value?? umask is use to determine/set
the Permissions that files and directories will inherit at creation. 
It is Good for file security. 
umask value set the Default files permissions for users.

9 out of 10 situations we will not be using unmask 
9/10  = chmod 
1/10  = umask  

chmod  = change the permissions for individual files and directories  
chmod 600 fileName    
chown   = use change file ownership  
chgroup = use change file group ownership

      date -S "ddmmyyy Time"

  2)sudo timedatectl set-timezone 'America/New_York
df : Report file system disk space usage
   df -h    how much space are files ultilizing 

3)hostname; sudo hostname newHostname    = set a Temporal/current-session new hostname 
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newHostname - set a permanent new hostname

4)hostname -i = list your privateIP address  
5)If server is working; Ping hostname OR ping Ip address 
ping localhost
ip a     = list the privateIP address including network interfaces

6)   DIFF WAYS TO CONNECT TO SERVER
1) USING the hostname - ssh ec2-user@ demo33
2) using public ip address-ec2-user@40.208.35.48
3) using private ip address -112.31.84.211

7)who  = list the users connected to the server and from where and since when    
w  = list the users connected to the server 
     and their idle time including load average/uptime     

uptime= shows how long a system has been running/has ran without shutting down 
           (higher uptime hsows better performance of system)

users = how many users are connected

load avarage: 0.90, OR 0.80 OR 0.94 , shows that we have to check the system very well bc the system resource is over utilized and the system is running on very minimal 
resources

      PING

ping: The ping command sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts.
      This verify if the host is alive 
   ping localhost  = check if your local system is alive/running   
   ping landmark.cm  
   ping mylandmarktech.com                **** you are working for a coy and a cx calls and says the website is nt working, you can ping the website 
   ping google.com

                      To check if a particular is running or not
telnet: 
for any computer or system;    a server/system/computer have 0-65535(65536) ports/addresses  
0-65535, ie port range
(65536 , ie no. of port or addresses

    ssh   = 22,  http  = 80,  https = 443

 telnet 172.31.31.46 22 
  telnet 172.31.31.46 80  
   telnet 172.31.31.46 443

       telnet landmark.cm 80 
   telnet mylandmarktech.com 8080 
   telnet google.com 80    


  STEP1: 
check for ip addresses = hostname -i
next 
telnet ip address portnumber

                             tunlp
checks available addresses and addresses that are in use 

netstat -tunlp:
  a server/system/computer have 0-65535(65536) ports/addresses 
we have address:  server ports/address = 22/80/443/etc  
  tomcat requires to use port 8080 by default 
  sudo yum install tomcat  
  sudo systemctl start tomcat   

  nginx uses port 80 by default
    sudo yum install nginx  
    sudo systemctl start nginx   
  http server also uses port 80 by default 
    sudo yum install httpd  
    sudo systemctl start httpd   


**** therfore if port 8080 isnt available, tomcat wont install because it requires port 8080 by default for it to install
      
To insstall:  sudo yum -y install net-tools
netstat -tunlp
  t = tcp,  u = udp,  l = listening, p = port, n = number  : 
netstat -tulpn  


its important to know there are some ports to watch out for 

 protocols        ports/address    
   ssh              22  
   http             80

   tomcat           8080 --- 8000  
   jenkins          8080      

****** THERFORE, for tomcat to run, we have to change the port address of one of them

                            SCRIPTING 4
 CHANGING SDV PERMANENTLY

1) ls -a = to get our hidden files .bashrc
2) then vi .bashrc and change HISTSIZE value

  = export HISTSIZE = 1500 , Save & exit file 
3)To enforce the changes, we run the source command 
     = source.bashrc
4) check = echo $HISTSIZE . will give us 1500
so even when we log out this user/session  sudo su - ec2-user  HISTSIZE is still 15

system defined variables:
  echo sdv starts  
   echo $HISTSIZE  
   echo $USER 
   echo $HOME  
   echo $PATH  
   echo $LOGNAME
   echo $SHELL 


***** run the "env" command to list all the SDV

**************************



           GIT 1

 git status --- tells us if our local repository/project directory we are creating has been initialized as a repository or not and also if any file has beeen commited to our repository
  git init   --- the first command       
    creates a Local repository [.git]  
    initialises the git repository
****without git init command, that is not a development repository, it  will not support any git command
git log           = to list the number of commit that we have 
                     ( so we git commit  -m "first version", then git log) then we get the commit id 


******  To add a file 
      ** working area to >>>>>> staging area
git add filename : git add boo
one file 
git add filename
few files
git add.
many files
git add*

 *****  TO COMMIT the changes

In our staging area  >>>>>>>>>>>> local repository
     git commit -m  "   "

*****  Git push
local repository   >>>> Remote repository
       git push ( push changes from local environment to remote repository)

******  git log           = list all commits  ( with their id) all versions
*****   git reset        = to go back to working area form staging area
*****   git show commit ID   =
  
git2 :  1;07;00
git clone   =     dodwnloads a version of the entire development work/project in your work environment
git pull   = pulls the changes to your local env

git remote -v    = to tell us if we have any repository detail in our local environment 
                         Tells us how many remote repository we are managing 

******to add a repository  URL in our local environment 
      git remote add paypal https://github.com /zebxz/paypal
 git remote add paypal https://github.comzebxz/paypal    
     i just realised that the "paypal i" before https thats the aiiasname not the last paypal


  
******* GIT PUSH 
   git push aliasName branchName  
(alias Name )master
eg;  git push pp master                   ***** Pushing to the master banch

                
            (alias name PAYPAL)
  git push  paypal master (from my local environment to general SCM)
  username for https://github.com:ceekeh
password for https://\legal 2045@github.com: token
we have to create a token bc git no longer accepts password

 ******* go to github 
select settings aand developers settings 

                   token classic
select personal access token and generate token    (less than 30days )
selecet all repository 


7)   GIT PULL  to see the work others have added to the project i have to pull to my env

After the task i pushed has been executed/worked on by other developers
 === GIT PULL paypal master 



                 git2 
1) git branch               = to confirm we have created dev
2)git branch dev             =  we run this command to create dev branch
3) git switch dev             =  change from master to dev and vice versa
4) we vi into app.java file
5)we git add.
6) we commit "m"
7) git switch :                 = move from dev to master
8)git diff dev (commit ID )    = we run this in master to review the changes that happened in dev             
                                  git diff (b0f7fcf) ie ID of the commit done in dev branch                by d push command, i bliv  we can push to either branches
 GIT4;  git diff (dev or stage) to see the changes then vi into the file & delete the conflict ie (the errors>>> & its lines)
         GIT4: Git diff pp/master   = to see the changes we are bringing over  (from the "master&dev branch" in the remote repo)
9) git merge dev               = if we are satisfied with the changes (done in dev in local repo)    
10) we ls  / get log    ( we see head >master,dev)   = to ensure all changes  from (git merge dev ) were applied in the master branch (ie we hv all the files/commit in the master )
11) git push aliasName --all     = git push pp --all ( this is done in master in our local repo )        ******* in what case scenario can dis happen, to push to all
                                     creates dev branch in remote repo and pushes the chnages from local repo to dev/master in remote repo

git push aliasName branchName      to push to a particular branch


git branch           = list the branchless 
git checkout/switch branch name =  git switch dev
git push aliasName --all  = push changes to all branches  ie to the master and dev branch in github (automatically creates a  dev branch if there was no dev branch before)
git push pp --all 
git branch - v             =  display all branches in your repo and also tell you what branch your currently working i
git remote remove alias Name    =  remove repo from the local environment 
git remote remove repo URL 


   git fetch --> It brings changes in the code to the LocalRepo   *** 2:10:00 ( this requires a review before merging) , MOSTLY recommended
  git pull --> It brings changes in the code to the localRepo and & Working area    ( this merges without a review)

git diff pp/master = git diff to review the changes ( pp is prof repository alias name) 
git merge pp/master = to merge the changes

git pull pp (ie alias name)
                 OR
git fetch (aliasName) ie PP    
Git diff pp/master   = to see the changes we are bringing over  (from the "master&dev branch" in the remote repo)
then git merge pp/master    = form local repo to workin area bc we used git fetch & git fetch brings the changes to only the local r


GIT4
 TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT
Vi app.java, delete  <<< HEAD  &  >>>>>>>>   stage
we git status : show us both files have been modified 
                        " both modified"


 Git cherry - pick commitID 
we merge a particular commit among many commits

 

                     HOW TO MERGE CHANGES IN GIT
HOW TO MERGE CHANGES IN GIT
 git merge
git cherry pick
git rebase

DEBUGGING
  IN THE WORKING AREA , to clean a code we are not satisfied with
git clean
git clean -n : tell you the files/changes that would be deleted in working working area
git clean -f : cleans the working area
git reset   : to move a file back to the working area from the staging area
git revert commitID :  to delete the latest commited files in the local repo for a specific commit
                        eg, he created a file, added it & commited, then ran "git revert the commitID" to delete the committed files both from the local repo & the working area, therefore the file no longer exists.


How to see/determine what happened in a commit
to see the details;           git show commitID
to merge a specific commit;   git cherry-pick 518110e  
good commit msg:"conflict fixed"  git commit -a -m "CONFLICT fixed"


55:30 ***********    DIFF BETWEEN TAGS & BRANCHES
difference b/w tags and branches :
=== Tags                                                  ==Branch
immutable                                                   mutable
Tags are unmodifiable                                      branch can be modified/modifiable
Tags are created After Production, once thers 
a release, it creates a tag                                creates while development is still -WIP 
recommneded to be created from Master  branch              can be created from any branch 
 to se aour tags: git tag                                   git branch
to create a tag: git tag TagName                           git branch BN
git push an (an alias Name)--tags                         to push to all branches; git push an --all           
git push AliasName tag TN                                 to push to a particular branch; git push an (alias Name) BM

 git tag TagName
******meee******  TAG WITH version & patch 
create tag: git tag paypal - 1.0.02
1 = 1 represents a higher version
2 = 2 represents a lower version
3 = 3 represents the patch


git stash        =     to take backup
git stash  list  = to list all the backups 

eg we have a number of backups 

stash@{0}
stash@{1}
stash@{2}
stash@{3}

git stash apply            = resume wip for the most recent backup
git stash apply stash@{0}  = resume wip for the 1st backup
git stash apply stash@{5}  = resume wip for 6th backup
git stash drop stash@{0}   = will delete backup
git stash pop stash@{1}    = It apply & drop backup 1.
git stash pop


 CONNECTING TO SCM/GITHUB USING SSH KEY
         1:49;14  ****  he said the ssh key can work for any of the repositories bc it was notadded under any repository, we just went to settings and added it 

This automates your authentication access to github ie no need for password PAT

        CEATING SSH KEY  ( and copy to your github account) *** **** 1:50:00, you can use the key with any of your rrepositories
ls/home/ec2-user/.ssh      **** he said he has a file called .ssh
 to create ssh key:   ssh-keygen  
the key has been created
then  ls/home/ec2-user/.ssh  
 then copy /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
cat  /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
*** 1:23:03 copy the key and paste in SSH tray in github then add the key 
*** 1:24:37 copy ssh url in github (find it in "code" in github)
****1:26;19 create an alias name for ssh url = Ada
ssh url = Ada git@github.com:zebxz/paypal.git
git remote add Ada git@github.com:zebxz/paypal.git
to push = git push ada master ( Ada now replaces the repo aliasname which we used that requested for pw initially)
