HELM ,  HELM ARCHITECTURE
 

Helm:                   ...... CAN GO TRU THE POWERPOINT SLIDE
  Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes applications.
Helm will ease the process of managing hw appl are deployed in our cl8
with the use of helm we can deploy diff appl in k8, remember if u wnt to deploy an appl in k8 most of the time like our spring app deployment, what was needed
to deploy our spring app????????? now we hv a stateless appl , 
We deploy workloads in kubernetes using kubernetes objects declared in manifests files:
 e.g we deloyed a springapp Stateless web application: and how many objects were involved?
we had to write a manifest file for :
     deployment
     service 
     ingress 
     hpa       atimes we also need this 
     secrets  
     configmaps 
all these was for one appl deployment
and in addition to this we are also deploying a stateful appl

   mongodb Stateful database application: and for us to deploy this app, we nid smt like this either we ar using
     deployment/ and or what else can we use with deployment
     service 
     ingress 
     hpa 
     secrets  
     configmaps 
     persistentvolumes  
     persistentvolumeclaims 
     StatefulSets

so all of this obj need to be written, we nid to write manifest file for all of this
and this is too much job but with the help of helm, it eases n simplifies the deployment of workload in k8

  Helm eases/simplifies the deployment of workloads in kubernetes   
when we did maven if u want to instal maven in ur cl8???
we cud wget , we nid wget so we hv to install it as well as the following, and all this was a lot of job to install maven alone

OPTION1:
  maven Installation1:  
    yum install openjdk14+      ******the preriquisite
    yum install wget unzip  
    wget  https://maven.zip 
    unzip maven.zip 
    create maven homeDir and environments variables   
---
  ***********************  you can use a MAVEN INSTALLAION SCRIPT to install all of this components  ...........
maven installation in ubuntu/redhatOS server:
  maven-install.sh  
  sudo yum install wget unzip -y 
  sudo yum install openjdk1.18  
  cd /opt   
  sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-4/4.0.0-alpha-4/binaries/apache-maven-4.0.0-alpha-4-bin.zip
  unzip apache-maven-4.0.0-alpha-4-bin.zip
  mv apache-maven-4.0.0-alpha-4-bin.zip/ maven/ 
  chmod -R 777 maven  

OPTION2:    ****************************USING A PACKAGE MANAGER
 maven Installation2: 
    yum install maven -y   

************ in this case option2 is preferred as its simplified SO we dnt nid all of the manifest file of option1 to accomplish this installaton deployment
so similarly when it come sto amven we can deploy appl in k8 using helm

*****************WITH THE HELP OF MANIFEST FILE , WE have deployed some:
Custom applications: these are appl developed by our developers, our team of developers hv developed this appl
    springapp  
    java-web-app  
    maven-web-app 
    pythonapp  
    nodejsapp  
  Third party applications:
    mongo 
    mysql 
    jenkins
    metrics-server 
    csi drivers - EBSCSI  
    CNI Plugins/Add-ons:
      vpc-cni 
      weave 
      calico 
      Flannel  
    nginx-ingress 
    RBAC: services in k8
      clusterrole and clusterrolebinding   
      Role  and RoleBinding  
      serviceaccount

################################################# ALL OF THESE involves manifest files

                  HOW CAN WE SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS OF DEPLOYMENT IN K8
We can simplify the process of deployment in k8 using  helm as a package manger

DIFF PACKAGE MANAGERS:
we use package managers to install packages:
  apt /  FOR  = package manager for ubuntu/debian
  yum /   FOR = package manager for redhatOS/centOS  
  dnf /  FOR  = package manager for redhatOS/centOS 
  rpm /  FOR = package manager for redhat 
  deb /      = 
  choco /  FOR = package manager for windows OS
  pip-python-pip = package manager FOR PYTHON  
  brew = package manager for macOS  
WE also have :
Helm is a package manager for kubernetes.

Helm concepts:
  Helm cli: = It's a command line interface used to work with packages to 
             install upgrade or uninstall 

         e.g you can run               
           helm install springapp app/springapp /     (he said that this is helm chart :app/springapp 
             helm upgrade springapp app/springapp  /     ..... to upgrade to version of ur appl
             helm uninstall springapp
             helm add repo    ********* to add a helm repository in nexus or other locations
             kubectl apply app.yml       

  Helm charts: are packaged kubernetes manifest files organised in a directory 
  format that can be reused
  helm charts are stored in helm repository and frm der we can pull the helm chart n deploy our appl in mutiple env
so we can create a helm repository n these helm charts are like artifacts n we can store them in repository like nexus as well as github pages
it has a cli wich we can equally use to run helm commands :helm add repo 
  Helm repository: -- 
      jar/ear/war, npm, python

############################################### HELM ARCHITECTURE ............

Helm 3 Architecture:
helm 2 Architecture= 

Install Helm 3                   .............17:52
--------------

E.G
Lets cal it a k8 client server , frm this serverv we can mk api calls like kubectl -apply, one we mk the call we are authenticated n ibside my cl8 w ev master &worker node
so once we mk the call, we need to be uathenticated, on th emaster  node the api authenticates u, it enusre u are authoirzed to mk such call, n the authentication allows
you to have tha kube config file, so the file is authenticating you thta yes u are permitted to mk the api call .. 
similarly w ecan execute commands like : 
helm install , onec this is done the same kube config file wil authenticate u but it will depend on the helm architecture, if u were appl helm helm some 4yrs ago since you hv 
multiple years of experience ,
for helm 2 architecture :for the api call  to be made (ie comm with your cl8) we nid to install an agent called tiller, it nids to be 
deployed in your cl8,, if its nt ders no way u can execute  the helm commands 
**********for helm3 architechure, we no longer need any agent
so the architecture3 is preferred bc we hv less job, no nid to install an agaent

************WE ARE GOING TO BE USING HELM TO DEPLOY A LOT OF APPL IN OUR env
we just deployed nginx  using a lot of manifest files, 

##########################################  helm installation script   ... helm3

************.................   need to have just one cl8 running going forward ........................... 24:30
we wil download helm  software
change the permission and
run the script

vi helm3.sh and paste the 3line script
or just run it one by one
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3               .... to download helm
chmod 700 get_helm.sh            ........... change permission
 ./get_helm.sh                      ...................install helm


we can run helm 
to seee the diff helm commands

so we can create our own chart to deploy our appll using th ehelm create command
before we create we need to install the tree command 
to check if tree is already instaled: tree
sudo apt instal tree


instead of writing our files for myapp
we want to create them
-# Create deployment manifests (helm charts) for myapp
mkdir app && cd app 
helm create myapp 
run tree 
we see the number of files that were created
4dirs  and 10files
so all the resources need we can find them in this dir

e.g          when u craete ur manifest file it comes iwth          ............ check powerpoint
javawebapp
     Chart.yaml      this includes #METADATA : this is data abt data... tells you what u are going to be accomplishing, some inf , explanation etc
     charts  #dir           .... manually managed dependencies
     templates  #dir
        deployment.yaml
        hpa.yaml
        ingress.yaml
        service.yaml
        serviceaccount.yaml
        tests
           test-connection.yaml
   values.yaml                ************************what is very imp here i sthis file bc this contains default values.. whtaever uwnt to create i sdefined in this file

lets check the template thats in this chart: the templete is 
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  helm template myapp          *********the template is for myapp
based on what we hv for the template these are going to be created
it wil create a service acount for u
evrytin defined 
this is a manifest file
it wil create a service
we can seeits created the default service type : clusterip
its cereatinga deployment for ur appl 
and here is the pod template for the dpeloyment
*************this template depend son the values , so we can also run the command helm show values 

ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ helm show values myapp/
i wnat to see the default value for my app
these are the default values
our replica is 1
my image is nginx 
but i can also change all this inf
i wil go to the values files, vi into it and cahnge it 
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  vi myapp/values.yaml
now if am deployin an appl and the image is coming frm a private repo, i wil hv to run image pull secret, i wil enter it here
we dnt nid a service account for this deployment so i can change true to  false
service type can also be changed frm clusterip to nodeport n or LB   n viceversa
am i creating an ingress, by default it says false , am nt creatin an ingress
am i autoscaling my pod , i can change false to true bt i wont do it ofr now
discolarations
tolorations      
affimity
     we can pass all these values here
***************these become sour default values

ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  helm template myapp 
now we see the changes i effected in the values file

############# i am creating helmchart from my own  custom appl, once this is done
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  ls
myapp
  ********* now i can deploy appl uisng this helm chart
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  helm install app myapp/
STATUS: deployed
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  helm ls 
we can see the appl , it was deployed in the dev namespace
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ kubectl get pod
thers an error , my app got an error in pulling the image
copy the image name
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  kubectl describe pod (the image name)
 we dnt have the version of the image its trying to pull , so the deployment didnt tk palce 
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  helm uninstall app
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ helm ls 
we no longer hav ethe deployment
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  vi myapp/values.yaml
change tag to latest
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  helm install app myapp/
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ kubectl get deploy
deployed
**************************so with the help of helm w ehv deployed thsi appl  with relative ease
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ kubectl get svc
we see the service we created
we can access the appl using the loadbalancer service but its nt secured discovery option
we wnat to upgarde thi sdeployment and change the service to clusterip and also the image version to v2
so we check dockerhub where our containerized images are found if we hv v2 bc k8 is simply manging containerized app ,so we use docker to conatinerized n k8 to mg8 d 
container
but we dnt hv v2 just 2
so we cahnge the tag to 2
so ww are deploying now with the version2 and clusterip
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$  helm upgrade app app/myapp/
upgraded
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ kubectl apply -f ingress-resource.yml
it has been reconfigured
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ kubectl get svc 
the service type has changed
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ kubectl get ingress
isee my ingress rule
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ kubectl describe ingress appas-ingress-rule
we see its routin traffic to the backend pods
but we unable to access the appl bc the Arecord has not be created
SO in route53, we create the record
after wich we can accses it online, traffic ias been routed as expected
this is helm for you
so with thw use of helm, we hv created our own custom chatr
so we can cfeate our chart with relative ease

we can see the ngnix/ingress- nginx chart as well as the version
i can check the template to knw how the files were written
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ helm show values nginx/ingress-nginx
we can see the value files for the nginx ingress
if u ae going to deploy nginx this is the values file
we can sue the value file to deploy the appl as expected
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$ helm template nginx/ingress-nginx
we can see the diff objs that will be created
service account is being created
config map
clusterrole for nginx ingres
role binding
service of type clusterip
deployment for ngnix ingress controller
all the objs need ed is being created
evrything needed is being deployed
at the moment we hv nginx ingress already deployed in our env
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-24:~$    kubectl get ns      .....................59: 41
we had created a ns called nginx ingress b4 the ns was used to deploy oour appl
kubectl get all -n nginx ingress       ................... we had earlier deployes an ngnix  before using manifest file we can now use n chart
evrything is fine
***we can delete all the objests here
kubectlt delete all -all -n nginx-ingress
service ngnix ingress deleted
################  we hv deleted our nginx ingress controller pod  so at this time the nginc controller pod is nt running bt are we able to
achieve this routing wit the absence of the controller pod, even if we hv this hostname created ?  we CAN NOT . bc the pod is gone ,
the LB service is gone the deployment is gone,in the nginx ingress NS everytin is gone, bt we are able to use nchart for this deployment
helm repo ls
helm repo rm nginx
we del;eted the ngnix repo we cretaed 
now let add another  repository, we hv some other chart to deploy nginx
helm repo add nginx://helm.nginx.com/stable
nginx has been added to your repository
helm search repo nginx
we hv a good number of manifesty file like nginx
we can also update this repo 
helm update repo
this wil get trhe latest version
*************i want to deploy nginx ingress n i want too use n chart 
helm install nginx nginx/nginx-ingress
error , ns alreaDY EXIST 
kubectl delete ns nginx-ingress       ...................1:06:00
deleted ,,,,,, 
helm install nginx nginx/nginx-ingress 
  ******************************error continued       1:06:40
so he cd into nginx  **********************************************bt couldnt rectify it  so he continued to explain1:11:16
i wanted to illustrate hw we can use helm for this purpose bt one of trhe tins i had wanted to xplain in the class today 
is the fact that we are going be using helm to look at other concept in k8 , 

we are goin to ne using helm to install 
helm to install and deploy:
  P/G  
  EFK  
  Rancher    
we cud als use helm to deploy our metrix server
so we hv a helm repository for metrix server, we cud do the same for, i already hv metric server deployed
so we cud do the helm add metrix server andwe can  deploy the  metrix server in our cl8 using helm
helm repo add metrics-server https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/

helm install metrics-server metrics-server/metrics-server 
helm install metrics-server metrics-server/metrics-server -n kube-system  
helm install metrics-server metrics-server/metrics-server -n dev    

am going to check on this nginx ingress bt again
################ we hv already deployed nginx ingress and we hv seen hw it shud wrk seamlessly
***************** so pls tk note its very imp 
########### we will also discuss RANCher as well to see hw wwe can use it to visualize and access our cl8

in the pas we hv created our own nchart for one of our appl
we hv an appl that we hv created nchart for, the appl is found in this github repository so if u want to see this chart
the chart are found in our github repository  
https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/helm-app23  
*******we can use the nchatr to deploy appl in our repository by jst adding this chart once we add d repo we can also update it
helm repo add webapp https://landmaktechnology.github.io/helm-app23/
helm repo update 

******************this is now for a custom appl
after the adding , we see we hv a chart called webapp
****************** so we can run helm search repo webapp   ........ (the repo we added is webapp)
******************* we can check the default configuration in this repository by executing 
helm show values webapp/myapp
if we are going to deploy this appl 
whata re the objects to be created ? 
 we can see auto scaling is enabled 
we can see the image  is mylandmarktech spring boot mongo
service is false bc w e dnt nid it for this deployment
lb service type
********************helm template will show show us all the object to be created 
its crtaing an HPA autoscaler
etc
we wnat to use the chart to deploy our appl 
helm installn app31 webapp/myapp
deployed
this is a custom appl of ours 
kubectl get deploy
kubectl get po
kuibectl dsecribe pod (pod name)  ................18:46
readiness probe is failing , the pod is unhealthy so traffic cannot be routed there
kubectl top node 
lets see hw much memeory is available 
helm show values ************************************ to see hw the trmplate is configured
the pod was successfully assigned, the liveness probe is failing, the pod is restrting
lets check the template  ******************************* helm template webapp/myapp
wa re suppose to get a minimum wait time for readiness probe which am not seeing here
am goin to revisit this in our nxt class pls 
but the main tin to master is that we are using helm as a packege manager ofr k8
when u use helm it wil create the manifest file and render the maanifest files n once the manifest file are rendered
u can deploy appl with relative ease


 .................................questtion
1) i installed the EKS Ctl tool 
with the EKS ctl tool, i created a 2nd cl8 with the EKS ctl create 
i use the eks ctl delete cl8 to delete the cl8 bt the the one the GUI i use EKS ctl to deletete the cl8 also , i wanst able to delete
it bt it did delete the node grp and i was wondering why it didnt delete the cl8 bt the node

ANS:
EKS has what is called EKS ctl 
EKS CTL Is a comand line utility for EKS, elastic kubernetes service
u can actually create ur cl8 by running eks ctl create cl8 or aws create cl8 , any one
n if ur trying to delete the cl8 using command, most of the time u must first delete the cl8 dependency like node grp
so if a node grp was created in that cl8, u must first delete the node grp , delete the de[pendency before deleting the cl8

2) WHAT IS THE BESTS TOOL WE CAN SUE TO MANAGE OUR CL8

ANS:      it all depends 
maybe u want to ask hw we can best deploy our cl8
............u can deploy ur EKS cl8 using terraform scipt, u can use commands to deploy your EKS ie rather than going to the console 
u can jst run on the CLI , aws  EKS create cl8 ( the name of the cl8) that wi;l create it or eks ctl create cl8 bt u nid to ensure 
that your EKS command line utility has aklready been installed 
so u can use :
commaNd
console 
terraform
once u do that u can now proceed to deploy appl bc ur main task is appl deployment
most time at wrk u are goinmg to join a coy that already has running cl8 , it cud be EKS cl8, kubeabm cl8, kops cl8
once the cl8 is already existing all u nid is to use the cl8 to deploy appl, so main task now is appl deployment bc u wrk in an env 
with existing cl8 already , so u are goin to be worried abt u appl are ruuing that are installed and exposed , u hv vol installed and all of that.


3) DIFF bTW helm and aws EKS 
k8 comes wit  a cl8 the cl8 cud be EKS cl8, kubeabm cl8, kops cl8, now once u aleady hv a cl8 u nid to be able to deploy wrk load in the cl8
the question now becomes how can i deploy workload ????  for u to be albe to deploy a work in my cl8, u id a command line utility called kubectl
u cud aslo us the GUI to deploy apkl , tahts what u nid for deployment, now aprt from using kubectl only we hv a package manager  we can use
to deploy called helm and helm can be deployed in any cl8 be it kops, eks etc once its installed u can then use it to deploy Ur appl

DIFF BTW HELM AND EKS 
 helm is a package manager for k8 while EKS is a k8 cl8b that come swith a fully managed controled plane provided by aws
so one is is a cl8 and the other is a command line utility and with the heklp of helm, u can reder ur manifest file, it can create the 
manifest filwe for u. 

4)   CAN U CONSIDER KOPS IN THE SAME LINE AS HELM??? .... is it the same as helm

ANS:
kops is a software used to create a k8 cl8
what do u nid need to deploy ur appl in k8 , u nid running cl8 , a cl8 thatb is functionig 
a cl8 is a grp of nodes  , that cl8 may v been created using kops or u cud hv created it using aws k8 service or using kubadm
it doesnt amtter what u hv used,all u nid is a cl8,  pnce u hv  a cl8 u can deploy appl
