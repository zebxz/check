AWS eks : elastic k8 service
it has benefits bc it can be integrated with other aws resources like ec2 instances, rts databases n lb etc
we are deploying the eks cluster from our mgt console 

we cannot create EKS on a default vpc
1) he went to his aws account  and created vpc in us west1
vpc shud hv sufficient ip address
4.g 10.10.0.0/20    gives .. 4096 ips
2 az
2 pub /privae subnet
need nat gatway to route traffic to the private subnet , so  (in 1 AZ)
enable dns hostnames
enable dns resolution   ,, OTHERWISE nodes cant register to the cl8
vpc n more was selected so all the components for the vpc will be created 

7.30
2) now we nid to do some configurations to the subnets (2public)  that are associated to this vpc, so let us go n edit the subnet
select the subnet n click action and enable auto assign public ip so that resources that are created here will automatically be assigned a public ip

3)iam role
under iam   , create role
aws serice, 
use cases: eks cluster nxt
paste ur name :eks-demo-iam-role
create

4) create cluster, for us to create, we can use the console n ill be using the console to create our cl8
aws serveice n select elastic container k8 services
we can aslo use :
GUI - Console
  commands:
      aws eks create-cluster  
      eksctl create-cluster 

      aws s3 ls 
      aws eks list-clusters 
and we can also use :
  IaC = tERRAFORM
create : we can creste using commands like 
aws eks create-cluster  
      eksctl create-cluster 

version1.24
select the iam role we jsut created, we nid to attach it to our cl8 so that eks can mange other aws services

ntwrking: select the vpc we just made
security grp:
we go bk to the vpc console
create new security grp : select the vpc we just made, allow all traffic/ all protocol
go bk to the cl8 we are creatin and attach the security grp we just made
ipve
cluster endpoint: public and private (so we can mk api calls)
next
configure logging: select all bt its going to be charged, so unselect all and next
select add ons: these are k8 add ons , like kube proxy, coredns, amazon vpc will be configured  nxt 
amazon version has iff options bt we ll just allow the default version assigned to us nxt and create
ow  the cl8 is being created, wil tk a while , took abt 10minutes

hw th cl8 works
EKS provides a fully manged contrl plane7
u provision an EKS  cl8 , ek8 automatically deploy control plane 
so while we aredeploying this cl8, aws wil create the control plane for us, the only thing we nid to do once the cl8 is provisioned is to deploy worker nodes,
so we can create our worker node grps then connect toe the EKS cl8 , then we can use EKS to run k8 appll, start deployin apps to eks cl8


now the eks has bee n provisioned, we nid to deploy our workernode into the cl8
create iam role for the node with this ploicies ... 23:56

iam
role create
common service: ec2
select the required policy , nxt
role name
create role

back to the  EKS cl8
click compute , add node grp
 node name
attach the iam role we just made
we can  addd label n value
on demand
inatnsc type: t2 large with 8 gRAM 
scalin g conf: 2,2,10
nxt, we see the subnets and w ecan choose the  subnet we want the node to be scheduled, (i can decide to schedule all my node on the private subnet, in that case if i 
wnt to expose the node, ill be exposing it using an xternal LB service wich is very possible)  for now ill just allow all the AZs ,, 
nxt , 
it failed to create the nodes so he  selected the subnets in public wich hv auto assign public ip enabled
i can also configure ssh access to the node, select .... , select  security grp 35:49
nxt 
node grp is been created n onec it is provisioned, if u come to compute, its certain the node grp
***********we can created multiple node grps

*to access the eks cl8s
in mobarterm , 
he has a server
cretae user : sudo su - ec2user
instal kubectl using th command bt he alsredy has aws cli istalled
i wnt to b able to access my k8 control plane, k8 serevr, to access my eks cl8
so we nid to run configure aws cli using bc i v to configure my aws access key n sacred access key

******* so bk to aws, in iam role , on the right hand corner, he clicked on security credentials
to create access key 4:30
key created
back to mobaxterm.. 
aws configure 
pste key 
us west1
json

aws eks list -cluster

next 
we wnt to b able to congifure the kube configure file to b able to manage the cl8
if we run kubectl get pod, connection is refused
so to est the connection :  aws eks update-kubeconfig --name eks-demo --region us-west-1 
now the file has been created, 
kubectl get pod
no resorce in the default name space
kubectl get node
2nodes hv been successfully deployed
we created a node grp with mini 2 desired n dis is what we v here

nxt install git if nt already installed
kubectl get sc
we hv this storage class deployed so we hv a default storage class bt we hv to instal the cli driver so mk sure that git is installed, if its nt 
sudo yum istall git
succcssfully installed
then, am goin to deploy the csi driver wit this command, this is very imp for storage, csi, its goin to create a dynamic storgae class for us n it wil be ver helpful for our
PV nad PVC 
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.12"

successful
kubectl get sc
succsesul deployed the ebs csi driver n this is similsr to deplying the the vexray pluggin in docker, so this driver will help us to dynamically create a PV and PVCs cos
now we hv a default storage class n with this we can easily deploy our applications
