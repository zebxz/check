AWS eks : elastic k8 service
it has benefits bc it can be integrated with other aws resources like ec2 instances, rts databases n lb etc
we are deploying the eks cluster from our mgt console 

we cannot create EKS on a default vpc
1) he went to his aws account  and created vpc in us west1
vpc shud hv sufficient ip address
4.g 10.10.0.0/20    gives .. 4096 ips
2 az
2 pub /privae subnet
need nat gatway to route traffic to the private subnet , so  (in 1 AZ)
enable dns hostnames
enable dns resolution   ,, OTHERWISE nodes cant register to the cl8
vpc n more was selected so all the components for the vpc will be created 

7.30
2) now we nid to do some configurations to the subnets (2public)  that are associated to this vpc, so let us go n edit the subnet
select the subnet n click action and enable auto assign public ip so that resources that are created here will automatically be assigned a public ip

3)iam role
under iam   , create role
aws serice, 
use cases: eks cluster nxt
paste ur name :eks-demo-iam-role
create

4) create cluster, for us to create, we can use the console n ill be using the console to create our cl8
aws serveice n select elastic container k8 services
we can aslo use :
GUI - Console
  commands:
      aws eks create-cluster  
      eksctl create-cluster 

      aws s3 ls 
      aws eks list-clusters 
and we can also use :
  IaC = tERRAFORM
create : we can creste using commands like 
aws eks create-cluster  
      eksctl create-cluster 

version1.24
select the iam role we jsut created, we nid to attach it to our cl8 so that eks can mange other aws services

ntwrking: select the vpc we just made
security grp:
we go bk to the vpc console
create new security grp : select the vpc we just made, allow all traffic/ all protocol
go bk to the cl8 we are creatin and attach the security grp we just made
ipve
cluster endpoint: public and private (so we can mk api calls)
next
configure logging: select all bt its going to be charged, so unselect all and next
select add ons: these are k8 add ons , like kube proxy, coredns, amazon vpc will be configured  nxt 
amazon version has iff options bt we ll just allow the default version assigned to us nxt and create
ow  the cl8 is being created, wil tk a while

hw th cl8 works
EKS provides a fully manged contrl plane7
u provision an EKS  cl8 , ek8 automatically deploy control plane 
so while we aredeploying this cl8, aws wil create the control plane for us, the only thing we nid to do once the cl8 is provisioned is to deploy worker nodes,
so we can create our worker node grps then connect toe the EKS cl8 , then w ecan start running k8 appll, start deployin apps
