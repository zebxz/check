System Resources/MGT Commands:  
===============================

                           how to mg8 your system


date : Print or set the system date and time
      date -S "ddmmyyy Time"

date -s "02Aug2023 19:10:00"
      [obi@demo ~]$ sudo date -s "02Aug2023 19:10:00"
      Wed Aug  2 19:10:00 EDT 2023
      [obi@demo ~]$
      [obi@demo ~]$ date
      Wed Aug  2 19:10:04 EDT 2023
      [obi@demo ~]$
      [obi@demo ~]$ sudo date -s "02Aug2023 19:24:00"
      Wed Aug  2 19:24:00 EDT 2023

  sudo timedatectl set-timezone 'America/New_York'
  sudo timedatectl set-timezone 'Africa/Lagos'

df : Report file system disk space usage
       how much space are files ultilizing 

    [obi@demo ~]$ df -h
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    devtmpfs        4.0M     0  4.0M   0% /dev
    tmpfs           475M     0  475M   0% /dev/shm
    tmpfs           190M  2.8M  188M   2% /run                                                                                                              mounted on root
    /dev/xvda1      8.0G  7.7G  6.3G  91% /       ***91% means usage level is very high &we probably nid to increase d disk size or add more disk in our server, / means 
    tmpfs           475M  4.0K  475M   1% /tmp
    /dev/xvda128     10M  1.3M  8.7M  13% /boot/efi
    tmpfs            95M     0   95M   0% /run/user/1005

du : Estimate file space usage.
  du -h   

hostname : Show or set the system hostname.
   James / mary  /   obi  / legah  
   hostname  
   sudo hostname newHostname    = set a Temporal/current-session new hostname 
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newHostname - set a permanent new hostname
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname demo33  
   ssh ec2-user@demo33  
   ssh ec2-user@demo33 
   ssh obi@172.31.31.46
   ssh obi@52.10.100.198


              SHOW OR SET THE SYSTEM HOSTNAME 
must be root usr ot change hostname 
hostname is the name of your server, its very imp for security, automation, testing and connection 

     ******** TO CHECK HOSTNAME
1)sudo hostname  new hostname = to set temporal/current-session new hostname 
sudo hostname class33 

2)sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newhostname-set a permanent new hostname


hostname -i = list your privateIP address  
    [obi@demo33 ~]$ hostname -i
     ipv6 = fe80::50:b8ff:fe51:243%enX0 
     ipv4 = 172.31.31.46

   
         TO CHECK IF SERVER IS RUNNING 
Ping hostname OR ping Ip address 
ping localhost

  ping 172.31.31.46   
  ping fe80::50:b8ff:fe51:243%enX0  

*********** you cant ping a public address 
if i ping a public address, -4 packets transmitted, 0 received
it menas my server is not allowing any access on this public address


 ip a     = list the privateIP address including network interfaces
 ifconfig = list the privateIP address including network interfaces  
curl ifconfig.me  = list the publicIP address


     DIFF WAYS TO CONNECT TO SERVER
1) USING the hostname - ssh ec2-user@ demo33
2) using public ip address-ec2-user@40.208.35.48
3) using private ip address -112.31.84.211


             TO KNOW WHO IS CONNECTED TO MY SERVER 
who  = list the users connected to the server and from where and since when    

   [obi@demo33 ~]$ who
   landmark pts/0        2023-08-01 19:06 (102.215.56.212)
   obi      pts/1        2023-08-02 19:46 (102.215.56.212)
   ec2-user pts/2        2023-08-02 19:46 (102.215.56.212)

   
https://whatismyipaddress.com/   
   My IP Address is:
      IPv6:  2c0f:2a80:d4:2810:2dee:32db:6e37:4419
      IPv4:  102.215.56.212
    Your location may be exposed!
   My IP Information:
  ISP: Starlink POP Lagos NG
  City: Lagos
  Region: Lagos
  Country: Nigeria

w  = list the users connected to the server 
     and their idle time including load average/uptime     

uptime= shows how long a system has been running/has ran without shutting down 
           (higher uptime hsows better performance of system)

users = how many users are connected


[obi@demo33 ~]$ w
 19:52:16 up 8 days, 39 min,  3 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
USER     TTY        LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
landmark pts/0     Tue19    0.00s  0.11s  0.02s sshd: landmark [priv]
obi      pts/1     19:46    5:52s  0.00s  0.00s -bash
oke      pts/3     19:46 4:50:52s  0.00s  0.00s -bash
   load average: 0.90, 0.80, 0.94
   uptime = server1 = 8 days, 39 min
            server2 = 388 days, 55 min

load avarage: 0.90, OR 0.80 OR 0.94 , shows that we have to check the system very well bc the system resource is over utilized and the system is running on very minimal 
resources

packageMGT, processMGT and ServiceMGT commands:
================================================

   packageMGT, 
     sudo yum install httpd -y
  serviceMGT,
    sudo systemctl start httpd  
    sudo systemctl enable httpd 
    systemctl status httpd 
 
processMGT                            ********** what evre happens in linux is a command 
    ps -ef | grep httpd  
    ps -ef | grep sshd  
    ps -ef | grep ntpd

                                How to install, updates and remove packages in redhat linux 

sudo yum insatll, wget -y  -- to install
sudo yum remove wget -y    ---  to delete


wget helps to download but 
package managers downlaod and install packages


webget: wget is a non-interactive netwrk downloaader used to download packages 
                        eg, download the tomcat9
wget|httpds://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/9.0.78/bin/apache

***** so long as wget is already installed, it can be used to download packages with the download link
wget can be used to download packages for our server


sudo yum install wget -y  
     https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.78/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.78.zip
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.78/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.78.zip          

Ticket088:
==========
install, start and verify the apache webServer
sudo yum install httpd -y   
systemctl status httpd  
ps -ef | grep httpd  
sudo systemctl start httpd  
sudo systemctl enable httpd  



apt install packageName- debian/ubuntu systems
brew install packageName - Mac - APPLe systems
choco install packageName - windows systems
yum install packageName - good for redhat/contos systems


Package managers are also used to downloadand install packages
yum/apt/duff/rpm/apk/chocolatey (windows system) /brew (mac)
yum install/remove/updates/upgrade


    dnf install chrony
    yum install chrony
