OP - os 
windows os
linux os
solars os
mac os

can a computer have more than 1 os at once??? 99%
window -WSL (Windows subsystem for linux) to make my computer hvlinux components and so i can perfomr linux task on it 
 Hypervisor --- virtual machines 
with hypervisor we can install virtual machines on our hardware/computer/systems

WHAT DETERMINES THE CHOICE OF AN OS (COMPUTER SYSTEM)
1) SECURITY:
85% OF our servers are linux based
linux systems are not vulnerable to virux attack
windows systems are vulnerable to virus attack

eg youare exempted/free from sickness

4) usage
linux oS mostly utilized for enterprise tasks eg creating servers
windows is mostly utilized as a workstation

5)performance
