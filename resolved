41.16 ...       TRYING TO CLONE A repository and get this error; 
destination path 'paypal' already exists and is not an empty directory
                                        git clone https://github.com/landmarktechnology/paypal
SOLUTION: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50361138/destination-path-already-exists-and-is-not-an-empty-directory
This error comes up when you try to clone a repository in a folder which still contains .git folder (Hidden folder).
meeee...... you can  make a new dir (mkdir projects) & change dir (cd projects) then clone the repo andcan further cd into the repo ( cd paypal) & ls to see its content.
     


Ticket :1:53:48 ******* in the remote repo in github, he also created a stage branch from the master branch, then updated the app.java file 
         got the pull req in the master baranch, accepted reQ 
     finally in the local repo, he run the git pull (git pull pay master) command to bring the changes from the remote repo to both the local rep & working env.

***** SOLUTION .....
I ran only git pull pay master & didnt run the same in the dev branch 
Then I tried to run the push command  "git push pay --all"  but it wasnt working
finally i cd into dev branch then run (git pull pay dev)   ****(guess I should have also run git merge dev , but NO, bc the changes was done in the stage branch in the remote repo & in the local repo we already pull it to the master branch, so i )
then "git push pay --all" worked.                                                                                                                                                       only need to pull it to the dev branch in the local repo too

**** THE ERROR *****

                                    TO  EDITING A FILE IN THE REMOTE REPO & TO RUN "git push pay --all" IN THE LOCAL REPO   (or mayb i can call it a pull conflict since theres smt called merge conflict)
   ##### I went further to experiment and with the try & error below i realised that ,in remote repo when you edit/add a line in a file(eg file name project) for eg in stage branch, even after confirming the pull REQ in master, u have to switch to the other branch (dev)  
& make sure to update it, if it says the dev branch is behind if nt in the local repo, when u pull, it will say update to date even when its not as seen in (1) below (mayb to clone is better but for now i dnt know)
ALSO, In the local repo, even after pulling in the dev repo, you have switch to the amster branch and pull before you can successfully run  git push pay --all

 In the remote repo, in stage i added a line in app.java

*** I switched to both dev and stage app.java was not updated 
so in stage branch i pulled, 
then again in master ran " git push pay --all" and it worked 
but when i switched to dev again and checked app.java, it was nt update
i tried to pull it says everything up to datei run "git push pay --all", it says everything up to date
but when i check app.java, its not ?

MERGE CONFLICT
i had a commit in stage branch and a diff commit in the master branch but when i tried to merge got an error " merge conflct so i had to merge maually




  i saw online **** TO PUSH to all repositories at once
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6865302/push-local-git-repo-to-new-remote-including-all-branches-and-tags
To push all your branches, use either (replace REMOTE with the name of the remote, for example "origin"):

git push REMOTE '*:*'
git push REMOTE --all
To push all your tags:

git push REMOTE --tags
Finally, I think you can do this all in one command with:

git push REMOTE --mirror
However, in addition --mirror, will also push your remotes, so this might not be exactly what you want.



MAVEN
  Maven-local-repo was accidentally deleted by a Jr. Engineer  
but that was not an issue bc i had earlier backed up the artifacts in the custom maven repo
by configuring settings.xml by pasting " <localRepository>/home/ec2-user/.mlr</localRepository>"
 sudo vi /opt/maven/conf/settings.xml


MAVEN2  
**MEE* There was a change in one of the modules developed by our developers and i was able to carry on with our project by passing the "P flag" to select specific modules to build thereby carry on swiftly with our project& preventing time wasted
how can a specific module be built in maven-enterprise application
for example, developers have done a change in module one 

 by passing the PL flag               
mvn package -P1  for profile name 
eg
mvn package - P1 maven enterprise -web  ***** ie we want build only the maven enterprise-web package
OR
mvn package - P maven Enterprise -ear  ie we want build only the maven enterprise-EAR package


57:00
so We can use the -p flag to do a build
by changing the profile name

57:45
if there are many modules but cahnge in only one module 
we build by choosing that particular profile
by using the ? web flag



 From bootcamp Dec26 
58:00*********************** NEXUS
    i was tasked to upload some artifacts into the release repository and i realised for some reason i kept getting build fail and when i checked the logs i realised i was using 
the wrong version in my pom.xml, instaed of ensuring that the versioning is tagged to releases it was tagged to snapshot, so i quickly went to my pom.xml modified the version
used the corret version which was snapshot and once i had to rebuld again via my pipeline that failure never existed because it was now uploading artifacts into the snapshot
repository that was expected.
