This error comes up when you try to clone a repository in a folder which still contains .git folder (Hidden folder).
meeee...... you can  make a new dir (mkdir projects) & change dir (cd projects) then clone the repo andcan further cd into the repo ( cd paypal) & ls to see its content.
     


Ticket :1:53:48 ******* in the remote repo in github, he also created a stage branch from the master branch, then updated the app.java file 
         got the pull req in the master baranch, accepted reQ 
     finally in the local repo, he run the git pull (git pull pay master) command to bring the changes from the remote repo to both the local rep & working env.

***** SOLUTION .....
I ran only git pull pay master & didnt run the same in the dev branch 
Then I tried to run the push command  "git push pay --all"  but it wasnt working
finally i cd into dev branch then run (git pull pay dev)   ****(guess I should have also run git merge dev , but NO, bc the changes was done in the stage branch in the remote repo & in the local repo we already pull it to the master branch, so i )
then "git push pay --all" worked.                                                                                                                                                       only need to pull it to the dev branch too

**** THE ERROR *****
$ git push pay --all
