This error comes up when you try to clone a repository in a folder which still contains .git folder (Hidden folder).
meeee...... you can  make a new dir (mkdir projects) & change dir (cd projects) then clone the repo andcan further cd into the repo ( cd paypal) & ls to see its content.
     


Ticket :1:53:48 ******* in the remote repo in github, he also created a stage branch from the master branch, then updated the app.java file 
         got the pull req in the master baranch, accepted reQ 
     finally in the local repo, he run the git pull (git pull pay master) command to bring the changes from the remote repo to both the local rep & working env.

***** SOLUTION .....
I ran only git pull pay master & didnt run the same in the dev branch 
Then I tried to run the push command  "git push pay --all"  but it wasnt working
finally i cd into dev branch then run (git pull pay dev)   ****(guess I should have also run git merge dev , but NO, bc the changes was done in the stage branch in the remote repo & in the local repo we already pull it to the master branch, so i )
then "git push pay --all" worked.                                                                                                                                                       only need to pull it to the dev branch in the local repo too

**** THE ERROR *****
$ git push pay --all

 ***** NEXT:
 In the remote repo, in stage i added a line in app.java 
confirmed pull request in master branch
in the local repo, in master i tried to run " git push pay --all" but it says error 

ekehc@DESKTOP-OQQ2EQ9 MINGW64 ~/paypal (master)
$ git push pay --all
To https://github.com/bibiblee/pay

*** I switched to both dev and stage app.java was not updated 
so in stage branch i pulled, 
then again in master ran " git push pay --all" and it worked 
but when i switched to dev again and checked app.java, it was nt update
i tried to pull it says everything up to date?



  **** To push to all repositories at once
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6865302/push-local-git-repo-to-new-remote-including-all-branches-and-tags
To push all your branches, use either (replace REMOTE with the name of the remote, for example "origin"):

git push REMOTE '*:*'
git push REMOTE --all
To push all your tags:

git push REMOTE --tags
Finally, I think you can do this all in one command with:

git push REMOTE --mirror
However, in addition --mirror, will also push your remotes, so this might not be exactly what you want.
