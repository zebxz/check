the syntax of playbook: playbks are written in yaml language and all files should hv with yml
yaml format is very strict with identation

if you have a task for ansible to do, you need to give it a module , like what program is it goiin to use 
if the task is to install a package then you need to give it a module that installs packages
if its to copy or transfr a file you can use a file module
if its to copy data that are changes/dynamic its a file that has variables and these variables will be read at runtime then we dnt use a copy module rather ansible rEQs you to
use a template
A template is just a mode whereby things can be put in so when u use a template module its a module that will copy dynamic data
