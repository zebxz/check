the syntax of playbook: playbks are written in yaml language and all files should hv with yml
yaml format is very strict with identation

if you have a task for ansible to do, you need to give it a module , like what program is it goiin to use 
if the task is to install a package then you need to give it a module that installs packages
if its to copy or transfr a file you can use a file module
if its to copy data that are changes/dynamic its a file that has variables and these variables will be read at runtime then we dnt use a copy module rather ansible rEQs you to
use a template
A template is just a mode whereby things can be put in so when u use a template module its a module that will copy dynamic data


8:30 
********************* START


14:36   TO INstall multiple packages      
    install_multiple_pkgs.yaml

18:48 
it is skipping bc of the conditons 
its using the setup module to read the variables then it skips a server when the conditions are not met
insatll webserserver on redhat 
install java on redhat
insstall webserver on debiem
install java on redhat
so we hv 4task that have been carried out
but instead of me running it like this i can break down this playbk, bc am still using conditions, i can reduce the lines on my playbk when i can create reuseable task

24:45
***** 
so for each of the 4 task executed in the playbk above, i can create a task for each of them and on my playbk ill  use what is called include_tasks to import these tasks  
so now each of these tasks are reuseable bc they are not tied to a particular playbk
so i can call these task in any other playbk by saying include_tasks and i just refernec the name , so am making my task to be reuseable
