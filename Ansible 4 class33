IMPORT TASK, INCLUDE TASK, FUNDAMENTAL DIFF BTW  import task and INCLUDE TASK,PASSING A VARIABLES, USING IMPORT WHILE PASSING A VARIABLE, USING INCLUDE WHILE PASSING A
VARIABLE, ANSIBLE ROLES, CREATING ROLES FOR PLAYBOOK, SUMMARY OF HOW TO CREATE ROLES..

31:14
dabiem and Redhat are both ansible os family 

29.08
setup module is the default module so even if we dnt indicate gather facts = true ,its still goin to run 
except i want it to disable it  then i have to indicate it as false   

1:16.00
these are template files, all templates file  we use what is called ginger templating 

1:20:00
wnat to trasnfer a file frm my host to my remote server, it is a static file, ie it doesnt hv any variable so it wont change

1:27:40
an ansible os family  is an inbuilt varaiable 
also ansible processor core is an inbuilt variable

1:32:15
bc the variable is substituted at run time  therfore, it makes it dynamic, ie when its running thats when the name will be substituted
so bc its dynamic when u use import,it will fail bc import only uses static 
so if i created a file with calibrases like this {{ansible_os_family}}., this is static meaning this name is not changing then i can use import bc import it will just tk
the file and transfer it as it is

###  RECAP

the syntax of playbook: playbks are written in yaml language and all files should hv yml
yaml format is very strict with identation

if you have a task for ansible to do, you need to give it a module , like what program is it goiin to use 
if the task is to install a package then you need to give it a module that installs packages
if its to copy or transfr a file you can use a file module
if its to copy data that are changes/dynamic its a file that has variables and these variables will be read at runtime then we dnt use a copy module rather ansible rEQs you to
use a template
A template is just a mode whereby things can be put in so when u use a template module its a module that will copy dynamic data


8:30 
********************* START

1)
####  
14:36   TO INstall multiple packages      
    install_multiple_pkgs.yaml

18:48 
it is skipping bc of the conditons 
its using the setup module to read the variables then it skips a server when the conditions are not met
insatll webserserver on redhat 
install java on redhat
install webserver on debiem.yml
install java on redhat
so we hv 4task that have been carried out
but instead of me running it like this i can break down this playbk, bc am still using conditions, i can reduce the lines on my playbk when i can create reuseable task

#####2)
24:45               install_multiple_pkgs_with _import_and_include.yaml

***** 
so for each of the 4 task executed in the playbk above, i can create a task for each of them and on my playbk ill  use what is called include_tasks to import these tasks  
so now each of these tasks are reuseable bc they are not tied to a particular playbk
so i can call these task in any other playbk by saying include_tasks and i just refernec the name , so am making my task to be reuseable

29:08 
********** 
setup module is the default module so even if we dnt indicate gather facts = true ,its still goin to run 
except i want it to disable it  then i have to indicate it as false 


  ##2i)
      
       FUNDAMENTAL DIFF BTW  import task and INCLUDE TASK 
1)When we use import task it just says
chANGed : 172.31.24.167
but when we say include task its giving us a range of information, the name of the task that is included
included: /home/ansible/ansible-mc-series/05-playbooks/05-using and include/install_ java_Redhat.yml
so include is giving us more task
again we wil see more diff btw include and import
u ll use include when you want to include tasks that have variables ie task that change
2) so we use import when we are using it on static data ie does not chaage



31.14
***************
install webserver on debiem.yml and install webserserver on redhat, 
dabiem and Redhat are both ansible os family 
so i can pass a variable within this name 
when i pass a vriable i can reduce this playbk (install_multiple_pkgs_with _import_and_include_.yaml )even further
i reduce it furtehr by been able to use thses as varibales so it pulls the right file


#### 3)               PASSING A VARIABLE
32:25
***************
so because am passing a variable, i can rewrite this playbk
 frm NO.2(install_multiple_pkgs_with_import_and_include.yaml) to 3A)(install_import.yaml) or 3B)(install_multiple_pkgs_with_include.yaml)

                     (install_import.yaml)
---
  - name: Simple play to install multiple pkgs
    hosts: all                                     ******am saying i wnat to import task 
    gather_facts: true
    become: yes
    tasks:                                                                    ******** if the os family is debiaem then it wil import debiem.yml 
      - import_tasks: install_webserver_{{ansible_os_family}}.yml    *** when it does the setup,its goin to import a task, if the os family is Redhat,it wil import redhat.yml
      - import_tasks: install_java_{{ansible_os_family}}.yml

so now am reducing my playbk frm  (No.2) to (NO.3), ie reducing it to just 2lines bc am now passing/using a variable


(1:27:29, further xplanation for kelvins question) if u pass smt inside the calibres, its a variable 
so we hv some predefined variables or inbuilt variables 
an ansible os family is an inbuilt varaiable
but hw do we knw
ansible web -m setup                                    ****** am running my setup module 
once i run this , it will go to my server/host and it wil return info abt the server, which icludes predefined variables that i can access
 ansible_processor_cores        **** i can access this info bc its a filter
to access this i can pass it as a variable  - import_tasks: install_webserver_{{ ansible_processor_cores}}.yml
so as i gather my facts, once it gets to my host, ist goin to stumble upon an ansible processor cores,  once it sees that, it ll return it here {{ ansible_processor_cores}} it
exchanges the value bc these are inbuilt variables, variables that hv alraeady been predefined inside ansible
thats why you need to knw what variable you are looking for 
e.g 
when i go tru this file, to the part of the ansible os family, it says RedHat, 
so when i was writing my code, i specifically wrote one of the file to be RedHat:install_webserver_RedHat.yml ,exact name as defined in d setup file:bc i want to substitute 
this name ansible os family, i want ansible to find this name, os family , is goin to find it as REdhat, then it will substitute it with the exact name 
but if i had changed the name , even just by misspeling it e.g instead of RedHat, i said Redhat, it wil fail bc it wont find it 
so am using my setup to look tru the instance, the remote host, so when it reads all the variables, it sees that there is an os family,  then bc in my defination am using a 
variable, its goin to substitute the variable {{ansible_os_family}}., with the right info in the setup
and we defined that if you use import, the variable will only be subsitute when the ansible playbk is running bc ansible has to go and get the fact first b4 it is able to 
read the variable, now bc the variable is substituted at run time  therfore, it makes it dynamic, ie when its running thats when the name will be substituted
so bc its dynamic when u use import,it will fail bc import only uses static 
SO if i created a file with calibrases like this {{ansible_os_family}}., this is static he meant if we had created a file named ansible os family then we can put it inside
the calibrases meaning this name is not changing then i can use import, bc import, it will just tk the file and transfer it as it is
but if i want to do it dynaically then ill use include_task, bc include is what substitutes values dynamically

###3A)                                               

34.24/ 36.12                                         USING IMPORT WHILE PASSING A VARIABLE    
                                                Running the s(install_import.yaml)          
 ran the script  but failed
error
 when using import you cannot use variables ,you cannot hv data that is changing bc this variable {{ansible_os_family}}is suppose to be substituted when the playbk is running
so we use import when we are using it on static data ie does not change


##### 3B)
38.31                                      DYNAMICALLY
      
                         USING INCLUDE WHILE PASSING A VARIABLE  (install_multiple-pkgs_with_include_tasks.yaml)
script ran succsessfully 

so we see how include can be used 
so coming frm NO.1, performing all that task but we hv automated the process and our playbk is now as seen in no3 above 
apart frm us writing reueasable tasks, these tasks i can write another playbk and still use them 
so this is a comcept like these are like your modules, they are reuseable task bt u are just calling them , including them in your playbk
and hw am including them , am doing it dynamically


so as an engr when you anticipate that these are the tasks that you are goin to do and these are the instances that u are goin to be wrking with, u can try and do it such
that you use building variables to dynamically reduce your playbk bc u are using variables that exist, you are using your setup module to be able to call these variables

41:30
******* if i was to disable the setup(gather facts) and say false then the playbk will fail bc these variables  {{ansible_os_family}}wil nt be defined 
bc ansible doesnt knw what  this is {{ansible_os_family}}, unless i hv defined it as a  variable  ie vars:, but bc am depending on the setup module to get the buildin 
variables so i hv to mk sure that my setup module is enabled, its set to true


##########  so we hv seen what import and includes does and the differneces
and we will see now that u can create multiple/diff tasks and just put them as a library and just call those particular tasks as you need  in your playbk taking into 
consideration when its static or dynamic



43:47  
*******************
so we hv seen that we can create reuseable tasks but ansible actually gives us a better way to reuse our tasks and these are called roles 


#####  4)
                  ANSIBLE ROLES

Roles let you automatically load related vars,files,tasks, handlers, and other known Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure.

After you group your content in roles, you can easily reuse them and share them with other users. How to create an Ansible Role

You can create an ansible role by running the command below.

$ ansible-galaxy init httpd --offline               ********* httpd is the name of the role
We need to pass the --offline option so that ansible does now initialize the role from the ansible registry.

45.43          if i go to google & type ansible galaxy, there are roles that hv alreday been created, the roles are online
*********    eg if i want to  create a role for prometheus and i just run the command without offline, its goin to download or intialize a role that is online 
so if i want to create a custom role i need to pass _offline 

This is done when we want to create a custom role.

After you initialize the role, cd into the various directories and vi into the main.yml file to enter the content.


###### 5)

                   ROLE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE    
***** when a role is created, it gives you a directory structure, which will hv all these 8 directories & each dir must hv a main.yml file 

 
An Ansible role has a defined directory structure with eight main standard directories.

You must include at least one of these directories in each role. You can omit any directories the role does not use.

By default Ansible will look in each directory within a role for a main.yml file for relevant content

tasks/main.yml - the main list of tasks that the role executes.

handlers/main.yml - handlers, which may be used within or outside this role.

library/my_module.py - modules, which may be used within this role (see Embedding modules and plugins in roles for more information).

defaults/main.yml - default variables for the role. These variables have the lowest priority of any variables available, and can be easily overridden by any other variable, including inventory variables.

vars/main.yml - other variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information).

files/main.yml - files that the role deploys.

templates/main.yml - templates that the role deploys.

meta/main.yml - metadata for the role, including role dependencies.

1:22:31
********* we hv seen these examples below while creating a ROLE 
You can also add other YAML files in some directories. For example, you can place platform-specific tasks in separate files and refer to them in the tasks/main.yml file:
# roles/example/tasks/main.yml
- name: Install the correct web server for RHEL
  import_tasks: redhat.yml
  when: ansible_facts['os_family']|lower == 'redhat'

- name: Install the correct web server for Debian
  import_tasks: debian.yml
  when: ansible_facts['os_family']|lower == 'debian'

# roles/example/tasks/redhat.yml
- name: Install web server
  ansible.builtin.yum:
  name: "httpd"
  state: present

# roles/example/tasks/debian.yml
- name: Install web server
  ansible.builtin.apt:
  name: "apache2"
  state: present
By default, Ansible looks for roles in two locations:

In a directory called roles/, relative to the playbook file in /etc/ansible/roles



#######  5i)
                    example of role directory
49.54  
                                       
                                         CREATNG A ROLE FOR A PLAYBOOK /CONVERTING THE PLAYBOOK (httpd) TO A ROLE


cd  07-Ansible\ roles/
07-Ansible\ roles/  ansible-galaxy init httpd --offline                                          **** httpd is the name of the role am initializing
  role httpd was successfully created      ***** and looking up, a dir httpd has been created inside of my Ansible roles 
and when i open the httpd dir, i see the 8 directories already created 

i can also build, 
sudo apt install tree -y
after installation
ill run tree httpd
now i see what the directory structure of my httpd looks like 

######### 5ii)                                CONFIGURING THE ROLE

52.24
************  now we nid to configure this role 
for eg
he copied the httpd.yml playbk and pasted it on the Ansible roles dir
  but now he added notifiers and handlers 

    - name: httpd
   hosts: web
   become: yes
   tasks:
   - name: Install httpd
     yum:
       name: httpd
       state: present
     notify:
       -  Start httpd
   handlers:
   - name: Start httpd
     service:
       name: httpd
       state: started


******* now ill copy the task aspect n in the httpd dir ill paste in tasks(main.yml)file
ensure its well indented
if i had up to 3 task, ill put all 3 in here too                                         ****** 57.34
also for the handlers part , ill copy it and paste in in the handlers (main.yml) file
now i hv my task n handler set 
so hv created my role for httpd and i now create my playbook


                                    


59.14          ###5iii)                              MY NEW ROLES PLAYBOOK  (Httpd.yml)
******** 
 for this remaining part, (which is my playbk) ill change tasks to roles and remove( name)  and add just httpd bc thats the role i created
  
- name: install httpd using roles
   hosts: web
   become: yes
   roles:
   - httpd
    

********** now i can run my playbook
bt this playbk is using a role, its calling a role, this role  has 1task and a handler 

/07-Ansible roles$ ansible-playbook httpd.yml
PLAY   [install httpd using roles]
TASK  (gathering facts)
ok
TASK [install httpd]                  **** its runing the task frm the role 
ok                                           **** ok  bc httpd had already been installed n thats why the handlers didnt run
RECAP  


    ****** so we see i hv cretaed this role n now its reusesable bc its nt tied to any playbk am just calling the role

#####  5iv)           CREATING A USER ROLE

1:03:48

we also see a role to create a user
it is goin to create a grp using a grp module   (1.11.40)

***** 
groups: 
     name: "{(user_group}}"
     state: present
bc i hv a notifer in the task, it means i have a handler
opening the handler(main), its just to restart
i also hv variables,and in the main.yml, i hv the variables defined there in 
in my task i passed variables uername and user grp

1:07:26
########## 

 now bk to my role playbk, i can add the role 

   - name: install httpd using roles
   hosts: web
   become: yes
   roles:
   - httpd
   - user_add                        *** this is a role that has been created, i want to create a user in my webserver
                                       so bc i hv a role created, i can just run it here n reuse it


******************* now i can run my playbook
/07-Ansible roles$ ansible-playbook httpd.yml
and we see all the task done
so it has run that particular user on my host
i can ssh

*******   1.09.00
ansible@ip-172-31-16-91 : ~ $ ssh 172.31.24.167
am logged in
ansible@ip- 172.31.24.167 :$  cat /etc/passwd
ill see auser called tom, that was added  with the home
/home/tom:/bin/bash

 **** we also created groups
ansible@ip- 172.31.24.167 :$  cat /etc/groups
we see a grp called engrs that was just created


******** so when we look at the tasks (main.yml) file , 
we created a grp and it wa spassed as a variables so we are making it easy so if hv defined/created a role, i just need to use varaibles
and am making this flexible, so bc am using variables, this task is reuseable bc i can create as many users as i want, i just need to change the variables
  it is goin to create a grp using a grp module
1:12:35   ********      am using a shell module to pass the ussr i just created into the sudoers file



**********
so i hv a user module that i can use, user_add
i have a update_repos to update repositories
i hv a role to create tomcat
apart from the task, 
i have a templates bc ill be passisng dynamic data, i wnat to add tomcat users, i wnat to pass the tomcat roles and PW 
SO HV copied this tomcat user.xml file and am using it as a template  and hv passed variables inside the file that will be read dynamiaclly 
thats why am using a template, template module will read dynamic data
so in the tomcat-users.xml.j2, hv passed PW,am passing 2roles, so  based on the roles that i pass here as my variables it is goin to dynamically do this
how am i passing these varaibles?
you look at your vars dir (main.yml), in there i hv all my variables for tomcat , tomcat user , PW , role , the url where am donloading my tomcat, the version, also changing 
the  tomcat port  and am changing that port in the server.xml and bc its a ginger template , i ends with .j2
these are template files, all templates file  we use what is called ginger templating 
is a file that that accepts variables, its a dynamic file , a ginger2 file
1:17:12
********** in the server.xml.j2, in the connector port segment, hv passed tomcat port as a variable inside the caliibrase
it is a varaiable bc it is goin to be read at runtime 
where is it been read?? .... tomcat port, inside of my variables
i just need to cm to my variables file and change, if i want my port  to be 8000 then thats the port that tomcat will run on 
if i want to change the tomcat user name , ill change it here
so all these things will now be dynamically passed to tomcat

in the context.xml.j2
we hv the esction that has been commeted out so that we hv access to the manger, so we can log into our tomcat
 so these 3 templates are been passed when you look at the task
we hv a template for authenticating with the manger
tmeplate for configuring tomcat user credentials and roles
template for replacing default port with required port
and after we hv cahnged all these, we will notify our handler to start tomcat


                         SUMMARY OF HOW TO CREATE ROLES 
1:20.00
**** it might seem as a lot of info , like its going over your head but just start by creating a simple role
create the role, intialize it , break down your playbk,didvide the task and wherever u created ur role, once u initialize it,go ot ur role, openn the dir, then just copy all
the task in ur playbk put them under the task dir, oprn d task dir and ull see a main.yml,open it & just paste ur task, those are the task for the role, if u hv any variables
that u hv passed go to the vars dir, vi into the dir (if ur doin it on the command line) cd into the vars dir and vi into main then paste ur variables 
if u hv any files, static files that you wnat to copy, i wnat to trasnfer a file frm my host to my remote server, it is a static file, ie it doesnt hv any variable so it wont
change, go to the files dir ,paste that file in the files dir, this will hold static files/content if i have a copy module.
if i hv files that are dynamic, ie files that wil change during execution then put them inside of the template, cos template support dynamic values
thats how you can easily create a role


1:24:00
******* 
You can use roles in three ways:

At the play level with the roles option: This is the classic way of using roles in a play.

At the tasks level with include_role: You can reuse roles dynamically anywhere in the tasks section of a play using include_role.

At the tasks level with import_role: You can reuse roles statically anywhere in the tasks section of a play using import_role


1)  example 
 what we did in    5iii)     MY NEW ROLES PLAYBOOK  (Httpd.yml)
  - name: install httpd using roles
   hosts: web
   become: yes
   roles:                                ****** this is at the play level, just using roles , its the traditional way
   - httpd
   - user_add

2) OR AT TASK LEVEL, with include roles

  - name: install httpd using roles
   hosts: web
   become: yes
   tasks:                               ******* so am passing it at a task level but am including a role 
   - include_role: httpd
   _ user_add

3) or i can import roles ,, so i can say either include or import,
but remember, we saw the limitation of when we import (if am using import,the data shud be static, but if dynamic ill use include)


1:33:17
