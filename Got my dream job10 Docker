***********   SUMMARIZED FOR INTRVIEW**********************

In my environment we use docker to run applications as containers
Docker: Is a containerization multi-platform software use to;create, build, ship, share and deploy containerize applications 
Compared to the Traditional/Physical Deployment & Virtualized Deployment options, containers are light weight,containers starts up very fast like a cheetah n the integration is very 
easy. containers also resolved the isse of repetitive task associated with the virtualized system, eg(having to install in the dev en & also testing env ) & thats because 
containers contains everything required for an application to run create or evry tin req for appl/process to run  (App Files (code), Dependencies, (Softwares +Libraries), ENV vars & Other Configuration files) 
Once we clone our application from our SCM, it contains the source code, Junittestcases, build script & docker file & with thw help of the docker file, we can create a docker image. & build, create containers & deploy.
*****ignore*** Docker Image; It's a package which contains everything (+Application Code + Libraries, Softwares+ENV)needed to run your application.
