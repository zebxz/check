In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD, JENKINS automates the end to end process, 
AWS for cloud computing services/resources, DOCKER for containerization, KUBERNETES for 



so from warheouse associate to customer rep to business teacher, every single one of those led me to this point, i didnt trow any of those skills away & trust
mw when i say you gonna get a slice of every piece of it.



In docker applications run as containers   
QUESTIO .. 2:27:00
is docker a replacement for tomcat
no its nt , its a newer version to deploy appl by containerizing the appl including the appl code n all its components ,, with docker u can deploy any type of appl including
python,nodejs, tomcat, docker can containerize any form of apllication



***********   SUMMARIZED FOR INTRVIEW**********************
Am good with docker 1&2, 5&5b & some of 3&4 videos

In tomcat applications are deployed in heavy weight virtual machines VMs:
In docker applications are deployed in lightweight containers:
****i bliv the short fall of tomcat is resolved by docker & the short fall of docker is resolved by k8... 

In my environment we use docker to containerize applications ie applications run as containers
Docker: Is a containerization multi-platform software use to;create, build, ship, share and deploy containerize applications 
Compared to the Traditional/Physical Deployment & Virtualized Deployment options, containers are light weight,containers starts up very fast like a cheetah n the integration is very 
easy. containers also resolved the issue of repetitive task associated with the virtualized system, eg(having to install in the dev en & also testing env ) & thats because 
Docker containers: Is a Run time instance of a docker image docker image contains everything required for an application to run create or evry tin req for appl/process to run 
(App Files (code), Dependencies, (Softwares +Libraries), ENV vars & Other Configuration files) & we are able to build images from a docker file
we have a docker file from the file we build an image from the file n the process of building the image is called containerization IE PACKAGING THE APPL with all its DEPENCIEDS IN AN IMAGE N FRM DER WE AR
ABle to run containers/ deploy applications
1:42 we v a build server,with the server we executing mvn package, creating package , we ar also building images  using docker file, for docker build n once dat is done we
can distribute these images , we can use dockerhub or nexus ,or amazon ecr or jfrog to distribute the images .. these images are push into the image registry and frm
the registery a lot can be made to happen ,, we can pull the images and deploy appls in any enev, therfore ,we can pull the images for deployment, docker pull to pull
d image n docker run to deploy the application, in the deployment server we v the pull n run and dats where deployment is taking place and this can take place in
multiple env like dev, stage and prod,, the same image ,, we can deploy in any number of env... once they ar built these images are shared/distributed 

meaning it can be easily reused as many times as possible.
with the docker exec command we can interact with containers, get into containers troubleshoot issues and do a lot of other stuffs as well.
with docker cp command we can copy from a container,  make modifictaions where necessary, and copy the changes to another container  
 copying files and directories between a Docker container and the local filesystem of the Docker host without needing to restart or rebuild the container
** mee*** and this is very useful bc the uptime of we appl is very important. we dnt hv to keep restarting our appl everytime we nid to mk changes so thats a 
plus with docker however k8 is a more powerful tool that knocks docker out the water & i'd be glad to expand more on that.



DOCKER5B
UESTION
with regards to out of memory issues, is der a way we can use autoscaling 
EVEN THOUGH WE Spoke abt out of memory, it rarely happens bc containeriztion itself has a lot of options that we ;ll look at when we get to kubertnets
### ull cm to realise that docker basically is going to ends with docker files
the rest we ar going to be using docker to create images, push the images and then use kubernetes to deploy the application
**** when it comes to deployment,we wont use docker to deploy bc docker cannot scale 
e.g u cant decide to deploy 10 replicas of webapp with docker but with kubernetes u can deploy as many replica as u want
bc docker cannot scale, it can only deploy one replica of an appliaction and that is a problem

  Is a containerization multi-platform software use to; create, build, ship, share and deploy containerize applications  
Docker is developed in Go Lang/Go Language.

O.S --> Cross Platform (Docker can be installed in any O.S)
        Docker Can Be Installed on Linux, Windows OS, macOS  
        Desktops as well as servers.

Docker is available in 2 Editions:

 1) Docker CE: --> Community Edition (Free to use)
 2) Docker EE: --> Enterprise Edition (Commercial/Licensed)
     EE is the docker CE+ is

Linux Flavors :there are diff linux flavors ie Linux distributors we can install docker on particularly the docker Community Edition 
 CentOS
 Amazon Linux
 Red Hat   : nt for docker CE 
 Ubuntu
 Debian
 Fedora
 SUSE Linux â€¦etc

**************** this is wher he now applied this command 
##########copy from a container:  
copy from a container:
docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp . 
docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps .

docker exec webapp ls webapps/tesla/jsps
home.jsp
i wnt to copy this file called home.jsp n modify smt 
docker exce webapp ls webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp
now ders a command called docker cp
we wnt to copy the filw called home.jsp to the container called webapp
this relative path didnt wrk :.   docker cp webapp webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp .   ,, i bliv webapps is wher deployment takes place in tomcat
 WE run decker exec webapp pwd ,, we can see,  /usr/local/tomcat   ,   wich is the absolute path

1:40;34 **** so we use the absolute path ,, here we copied the webapps dir to the container webapp
docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps .
and it says successfully copied to /home/ubuntu/.   ,, we wre unable to copy bc we wre using the relative path
ls n we can see /webapps  ...... i bliv this was copied to the pwd ,, i understand bt i can still ask ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????
now if i wnt to copy that exact file that is inside webapps (/tesla/jsps/home.jsp)
  docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp . 
successfully copied , we can see /home.jsp ,,,, i bliv this was copied to the pwd ,, i understand bt i can still ask ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????
COPIED TO  /home/ubuntu/ .
#######  vi /home.jsp    , to change one line
we change the line but when we check on the browser , we stil cant seee the change
we wnt the change to b part of the container so i v to copy file to my container 

*******1:45:28 copy file to a container:
docker cp home.jsp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/ 
now we v successfully copied it to the webapp conatiner 
it shows :COPIED TO webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/ 
and when we check in the browser we can see the line that we changed
