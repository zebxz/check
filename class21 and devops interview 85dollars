STARTS

loks like u pretty gud in powershell, AWS experience , terafrm ansibel, bash python
u knda of done a lot of things it seems like
wHAT TYPE OF WORK DO U YOU REALLY LIKE TO DO 
ans:

am looking at any devops role, that gets to do with automation which i can leverage my skills, to work in a dynamic env and challenging team , thats what am looking at

WHAT TYPE OF WRK ARE U DOING RIGHT NOW
ans:
at the moment, i wrk as senior devops engr ,i lead a team thta we mg8 a banking ckient, their micrro service and afew microlicthic applications, we hv been been able to 
provison the infraSTRUE using terfrm, configuring the entire infrasture using ansible, both with static and dynamic inventory , making use of software development kits like
boto3, python ..... so basically thats hw we do provision and configure the infrasture and we hv java based appl ,and some .net appl that are running so basically with those
appl we hv setup a jenkins pipeline using cloud beast jenkins, on the pipeline we hv integrated all the relevenat tools which include maven to do a build, ms build  for the 
.net code, then once maven does the build executting all the goals frm validation to compilATION ,to testing , creating the package, we hv integrated sonarqube foR continous
code quality and it wil execute the quality report, we equally upload our build artifacts into nexus,so we use nexus for our artifcatory repository, once its uploaded,we use
jenkins to deploy in our targeted env , our monolothic appl, we deploy them straight on to jboss web logic and tomcat server , for microservice appl we hv been able to 
configure both mg8d and self mg8d k8 cl8 , we equally hv k8 cl8 that we hv configured using kobs, we use docker run time engine and for containerisation,we use k8 to mg8 the 
containers for containers ochestration.... so thats basically the env we hv been able to setup , we hv meetings here and ther, we hv steup monitoring tools as well ,
we v newrelic, that we hvc created monitors to monitor the Apis , restful APis to ensure that appl are available and performing as expected
in our microservice env we equally hv ELK , elastic search, fibric and kibana, promethus & grafana , equlaly configured for monitoring , we euqally hv jira intrgrated for bug 
tracking, so basically hats what is happening,on a daily basics i mg8 those appl ensur ethta everytin is running, if thers any isues, we troubleshoot n get them resolved.

hv equally helped automate our patching env for user mgt, patching appls in our linux and windows env using ansible, but when our systems main teams hv any isues thats when 
i intervene and the tickets are escalated, we look at it and get whateevr issues resolved , so basically thats how my current activitiesare in my current project am supporting


ON THE PATCHING SIDE YOU SAY U USE ANSIBLE, IS THAT ANSIBLE TOWER?
ans;
yes, we hv borth ansible tower and we equally use the CLI, but w egenerally use the CLI, we are stil trying to introduce the tower am actually on a project now, the project
was assigned, il be doing a presentation, my contract wil expire this month, even though the coy is considering the review, bt we hv other types that we are doing, we are 
actually on a project now trying to introduce ansible tower and am the working on that, i hv to do a presentation with the team thsi week 

6:55     WHAT TYPE OF PLANNING CEREMONIES DO YOU USE  ... (Canaban, scrub , anything like that??

 i equally hv a subscription with linkedin so frm my mrn subscription i study a lot of emerging technology 
am equally part of the team that setup SOPs , so when tins are actualy changing we nid to sit down look at it and knw whw to adopt development n new tech in our peojects to
be able to improve n serve our clients better


CAN YOU TELL MORE ABOUT YOUR CLOUD EXPERIENCE  .... aws experience
ans:
i have xperience in aws frm creating ec2 instances to assigning them auto scaling groups , launch tmplate, lB ,elb  AND NETWRK load balancers , s3 buckets for storage

cloud with internate gate ways routing tables  both public n private subnets so basically i hv all of that inf , those are the services that we actively use and 
equally IAM for identity acess mgt for setting up grp policies as a matter of IAM is what we use daily, bc for u to be able to autoamte infrastructure, provisioning 
with terfrmu nid to hv the right permision or u wont be ablt to create certain infrastrure, so frm IAM we are ablt to automate infrature, provisoning, grant rEQ access in
AWS.
i equally hv exp frm with/most of the dev tool frm code star, to cloud9 to aws code commit, aws code pipeline , automating with jenkins and automating on aws
hv configured on aws pipeline both internal and external ide, like elclipes for eg , just to get the host/whole dev env integrated so basicaly those are some of the services 
have used  in aws on which we get touse in our projects


WHAT ABOUT ON THE SECURITY LEVEL , IF U HADE SAFIA, PCI OR  SACK SMT like that

interviewer asking if he has experience with ACM and KMS  .. KEY Mgt service
i equally have experience with AWS secret manger, creating TCL certificate and stuff 
 we hv a very strong cyber security team also that we all work together acrosss functional teams 

15:00
TELL ME yoUR EXP WITH GIT 
WE advice developers not to commit broken code to avoid merge conflit, to get task done before committing and any issues they hv to back it up with git stack command
we equally recommend  git rebASE OVER git merging so that we are able to track changes were done before ther was a merge  


interviewer : wow you just got my rebase question, i ususlaly trow a rebase question

   TELL ME DIFF BTW A PULL AND A FETCH
a FETCH UR COPying the code FRM THE remote repository to the local repository but when u pull the code gets to the local area

INTERVIEWER: Perfect thank u , you got my 3 questions


 WHATS YOU COMFORT LEVEL AROUND WINDOW SERVERS??

ANS: AM very comfortable with window servers
even now we hv a lot of our applications running on windows servers
our aws servers is configured on windows servers
we do all the configuration using powershell scripts as well so we hv all of those things runinng  so am very comfortable with linux and windows servers


DO YOU HAV EOTHEREXP WITH HARSICORP TOOLS?
i hv exp with vigram, hv used vengram to provision infrastructure mostly on vm ware and virtual box and also on aws cloud

interviewer said somethings they also use it for 
  interviewee replied: one thing i know is you knw the skills is equally transferrable , once u master the concept and what you  shud achieve, its easy for you to be able to
migrate skills from one platfrm to another

INTERVIEWER : thats true , my 6years in this am still learning, u knw a lot of it moves towards similar logic , its only slightly diff


YOU HV DATA BASES INFO ON YOUR RESUME, LETS talk abt it for the next couple of minutes

ANS: 
yes like some of our k8 cl8 tat hv configured runs on our secured database to be able to maintain the statefile,  stateful appls, we also hv stuffs like mongodb
hv also configured pos QL, my SECURE THATS RUNS WITH ANSIBLE tower and sonarqube for code quality

INTERVIEWER:
so we are actually using ansible tower and curently in the process of rebuilding

Do you you that as far as the building the main tower itself?

INTERVIEWEE:
thats actually a new project assigned to me to do more research on it, so i just did a demo on that bc we wnt to start using a tower as weell, i was tasked with the tower 
configuration which hv done by default it can comes with pos sQL secure so hv been able to configure that  bt hv configure pos QL secure as well for our sonarqube server to
be able to execute quality report to be able to delivery the best possible quality software to our client 
basically thos eare the databases hv worked with both relational and non relational , hv been able to work on them


24:02  ............ I didnt get the question ... voice  nt clear
  HOWS ABOUT APPLICATION REBASES OR REMATCHING ?
ANS:
yes nt entirely bt hv configured rarely some aws cloud for one of our monolithic appl
bc we actually hv a database team as well which  we work with together just to ensure, since i mean its a bank, we actuualy hv enough support from certain core areas just to
ensure we are able to meet the increasing and dynamic needs 


INTERVIEWEE
my question is are you guys developing softwares , you supporting cos i went tru your website, i saw a lot of clients  u have, like 5guys
