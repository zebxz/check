boto3, python ..... so basically thats hw we do provision and configure the infrasture and we hv java based appl ,and some .net appl that are running so basically with those
appl we hv setup a jenkins pipeline using cloud beast jenkins, on the pipeline we hv integrated all the relevenat tools which include maven to do a build, ms build  for the 
.net code, then once maven does the build executting all the goals frm validation to compilATION ,to testing , creating the package, we hv integrated sonarqube foR continous
code quality and it wil execute the quality report, we equally upload our build artifacts into nexus,so we use nexus for our artifcatory repository, once its uploaded,we use
jenkins to deploy in our targeted env , our monolothic appl, we deploy them straight on to jboss web logic and tomcat server , for microservice appl we hv been able to 
configure both mg8d and self mg8d k8 cl8 , we equally hv k8 cl8 that we hv configured using kobs, we use docker run time engine and for containerisation,we use k8 to mg8 the 
containers for containers ochestration.... so thats basically the env we hv been able to setup , we hv meetings here and ther, we hv steup monitoring tools as well ,
