ans:
at the moment, i wrk as senior devops engr ,i lead a team thta we mg8 a banking ckient, their micrro service and afew microlicthic applications, we hv been been able to 
provison the infraSTRUE using terfrm, configuring the entire infrasture using ansible, both with static and dynamic inventory , making use of software development kits like
boto3, python ..... so basically thats hw we do provision and configure the infrasture and we hv java based appl , and some .net appl that are running so basically with those
appl we hv setup a jenkins pipeline using cloud beast jenkins, on the pipeline we hv integrated all the relevenat tools which include maven to do a build, ms build  for the 
.net code, then once maven does the build executting all the goals frm validation to compilATION  , to testing , creating the package, we hv integrated sonarqube for  continous
code quality and it will execute the quality report, we equally upload our build artifacts into nexus, so we use nexus for our artifcatory repository, once its uploaded, we use
jenkins to deploy in our targeted env , our monolothic appl, we deploy them straight on to jboss web logic and tomcat server , for microservice appl we hv been able to 
configure both mg8d and self mg8d k8 cl8 , we equally hv k8 cl8 that we hv configured using kobs, we use docker run time engine and for containerisation, we use k8 to mg8 the 
containers for containers ochestration.... so thats basically the env we hv been able to setup , we hv meetings here and ther, we hv steup monitoring tools as well ,
we v newrelic, that we hvc created monitors to monitor the Apis , restful APis to ensure that appl are available and performing as expected
in our microservice env we equally hv ELK , elastic search, fibric and kibana, promethus and grafana , equlaly configured for monitoring , we euqally hv jira intrgrated for bug 
tracking, so basically hats what is happening,on a daily basics i mg8 those appl ensur ethta everytin is running, if thers any isues, we troubleshoot n get them resolved.

hv equally helped automate our patching env for user mgt, patching appls in our linux and windows env using ansible, but when our systems main teams hv any isues thats when
