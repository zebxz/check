            WHAT IS A COMPUTER ?
a computer is an electronic device that can store, process and display information
Its a device with both hard and software componentsused to run task and processes
computer hardware: comes with modarboard, keyboard, RAM, mouse, harddrive, CPU, cards, screen/monitor etc

 SOFTWARE COMPONENTS
1) OS- Operating system which is the heart of a computer 
2) other softwares: microsoft office, adobe reader, antivirus , sublime etc

   VENDORS /MANUFACTURERS
Lenovo/dell/hp/apple/Acer/asus/toshiba


     CLASSIFCATION OF COMPUTER  
Personal computers:
Desktop, laptop,/ipad/ tables/ phones/notebook/watches etc 


    ENTERPRISE COMPUTERS
workstation, servers (super computer)


The operating system running in a computer defines the computer type
OP - os 
windows os
linux os
solars os
mac os
ios os
android smartphones (smasung motorola)
if a lenovo laptop is running linux os = linux system
hp laptop is running with solar os - sloars system
dell ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, windows os - windows system

WHAT DETERMINES THE CHOICE OF AN OS (COMPUTER SYSTEM)
1) SECURITY:
85% OF our servers are linux based
linux systems are not vulnerable to virux attack
windows systems are vulnerable to virus attack

eg youare exempted/free from sickness
be sick and get treated

2) cost 
linus is a freee and open source OS
windows is a lincenced and paid OS

3) support 
linux has a very large effective and free community support (200m people)
windows support is available only from microsoft (100m people) but paid 
eg   1m possible helpers to resolve my issue for free
      1k possible helpers to resolve my issue at a cost


4) usage
linux oS mostly utilized for enterprise tasks eg creating servers
windows is mostly utilized as a workstation

5)performance
6) Reviews
7) speed
8) scalability and elasticity - ie can it be scaled ?


HOW ARE TASKS EXECUTED/PERFORMED ON A COMPUTER SYSTEM
1) gui CONSOLE: Graphic user interface
         graphic user - 2hours
       25000 UI ---- 65k usd per 
2) CLI - command line interface (accomplish task faster)
         command user  --5 min
    Engineers/administartors -120k - 400k per yr
powershell
gtbash
terminal - mac OS

using CLI we can use gitbash and perform task faster than GUI
