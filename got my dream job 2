                              LINUX
            WHAT IS A COMPUTER ?
a computer is an electronic device that can store, process and display information
Its a device with both hard and software componentsused to run task and processes
computer hardware: comes with modarboard, keyboard, RAM, mouse, harddrive, CPU, cards, screen/monitor etc

 SOFTWARE COMPONENTS
1) OS- Operating system which is the heart of a computer 
2) other softwares: microsoft office, adobe reader, antivirus , sublime etc

   VENDORS /MANUFACTURERS
Lenovo/dell/hp/apple/Acer/asus/toshiba


     CLASSIFCATION OF COMPUTER  
Personal computers:
Desktop, laptop,/ipad/ tables/ phones/notebook/watches etc 


    ENTERPRISE COMPUTERS
workstation, servers (super computer)


The operating system running in a computer defines the computer type
OP - os 
windows os
linux os
solars os
mac os
ios os
android smartphones (smasung motorola)
if a lenovo laptop is running linux os = linux system
hp laptop is running with solar os - sloars system
dell ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, windows os - windows system

WHAT DETERMINES THE CHOICE OF AN OS (COMPUTER SYSTEM)
1) SECURITY:
85% OF our servers are linux based
linux systems are not vulnerable to virux attack
windows systems are vulnerable to virus attack

eg youare exempted/free from sickness
be sick and get treated

2) cost 
linus is a freee and open source OS
windows is a lincenced and paid OS

3) support 
linux has a very large effective and free community support (200m people)
windows support is available only from microsoft (100m people) but paid 
eg   1m possible helpers to resolve my issue for free
      1k possible helpers to resolve my issue at a cost


4) usage
linux oS mostly utilized for enterprise tasks eg creating servers
windows is mostly utilized as a workstation

5)performance
6) Reviews
7) speed
8) scalability and elasticity - ie can it be scaled ?


HOW ARE TASKS EXECUTED/PERFORMED ON A COMPUTER SYSTEM
1) gui CONSOLE: Graphic user interface
         graphic user - 2hours
       25000 UI ---- 65k usd per 
2) CLI - command line interface (accomplish task faster)
         command user  --5 min
    Engineers/administartors -120k - 400k per yr
powershell
gtbash
terminal - mac OS

using CLI we can use gitbash and perform task faster than GUI

LINUX OS AND LINUX COMMANDS: Mobaxterm
linux is an open source operating system
linux started around 1991 by linus torlvads


linus was using a solar system for his project when he ecountered a problem while running his project, he tried seeeking help but the vendor for the solars must be contacted
for help so he decided to create something else that can be easily for help and for free

working on his project using a solar system, linus created the linus OS from the solars kernel/os 
linux is an open source OS with multiple distributors and or versions
windows, solars, MacOS, etc are licenced OS 


      HOW CAN SOFTWARES BE PROVIDED?
SOFTWARES can be provided as??
1)open source software (free with the source code) 
open source softwares has more community support

2) free softwares:
free but without the source code  (recipe) 

3) lincenced softwares: (paid for windows os, office 365


FOLLOWING ARE THE LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS :
1) Redhat linux  2) Centos linux   3) Ubuntu linux  4) Suse linux 5) Fedora linux
6) Gentoo linux  7) mandriva linux 8) Debian linux  9) slackware  10) Amazon linux 2AMI 
11) faule - linux, landmark linux

     LINUX COMMANDS
WhAt can be done on my server after accessing it 

1)file management in linux, we have to look at the file structure, the nomeclature, how it is being named 
file mgt releted tasks:

How are files Called in linux        
Windows                                            linux/mac
files                                                files
folder /foldes                                   directory/directories (container of files)
Sub-folders                                           sub - directories


root dIRECTORY: the root directory created when you launch a windows system it starts from C:\
ROOT DIR for linux is - forward /               ( / this is root dir, its root env owned by root  , cd /, trying to get into root user

the root directory [/] is the main principal dir where other directories and sub-directories are created from 

COMMANDS:
sudo - to create a new user
Ls -a = list directory content with files and & dir 
starting with . ie including (hidden)files   ********* i added this hidded when i was making the summarized notes
                                                           
commands : ls dir name =  eg ls pwd                                          ls/filename1/file inside file1
ls = list the content of a directory = list the content of your pwd eg ls OR ls /home/ec2-user  ... BC /home/ec2user is my pwd
pwd = present working directory
hostname = serverName
cd = change directory
commands to change hostname : sudo hostnamectl set-hostname demo
                                sudo su - ec2-user
sudo su - user = to switch user


root directory 
[root -user@demo ~ ] ls       ***** checking for files in the home dir
[root -user@demo ~ ]............ we get  nothing bc we dnt hv any files (yet)in the home dir, i added yet while makin summary note
[root -user@demo ~ ] ls /      ie to list the content of the root dir
bin home media  root sys
boot lib mnt run tmp
dev lib64 opt sbin usr
etc local proc  siv var

                                            HOME; contains users' home directory details 
home contains user home directory information eg
when we check
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls/home 
ec2-user
ec2-user [a user created by the system}
lets add user domi(sudo add user domi) 
lets add user obi (sudo adduser obi) 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo adduser obi
[ec2-user@demo~] $
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls/home 
ec2-user domi obi


bin contains binary files (commands)
cat fileName: used to read the content of a file
ls, pwd, clear, cd, touch (to create a new file)    eg  touch test.txt
cat -n filename
******30:18
i just did adduser paul and paul was created

                                              SBIN 
we also hv system binary files ,can only be executed by user with admin priviledges ,the admin-user/or the root user/administrator 
sbin: contains system binary files/commands
eg of system binary files : 
adduser, to add user
passwd, : can be used to assign passwd to users
chage, used to modify users expiry date 
chown  change own 

we aslo hv the etc dir 
also var dir 

****** administrator is called root user

************************************  in performing task in linux, there are diff category of users

26:00/30.35
                             INTERVIEW QUESTION
What is the diff btw bin and sbin directory in linux ??
SBIN: are system binary files only executable by users with adminstrative or elevated priviledges or admin/root user
eg adduser , chage

                              WHILE
BIN : Binary fies executable by any user (normal user& admin user)
eg ls, pwd, cd, touch

          ###########what is configuration file ??
  configuration files (commonly known simply as config files) are files used to configure the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs or applications, 
server processes and operating system settings.


we can cat to check the content of etc/shadow ie info abt the passwd of user
[root@demo~] # cat/etc/shadow 

etc : contains configuration files
/etc/shadow = detail information about users passwd
/etc/passwd = detail inf abt users                         ****** contains file of all users
/etc/ssh/sshd_config = ssh configuration details
   ssh=secure shell
sshd = ssh service/ daemon = user Name/passwd    eg to access your server via ssh you need username/passwd OR username & ssh key
UserName/ssh -private-key

- tmp: temporal files
-opt: directory where softwares & packages should be installed, it is the best place to install 
- var: var directory contains dynamic files
eg /var/logs/messages

-pro directory: Contains inf about the hardware (hardware info)
eg mem info - memory information
cpu info  - cpu information
ï¼»root@demo-# cat/proc/meminfo = to check for info about my memory


                                                               LINUX 3a

                  RESOURCE ULTILIZATION
sOft link is more resource efficient bc it uses minimal resources of our system 
soft link points to our original file/doc but hard link is a copy of the file 

while the original file is deleted, we cannot access the original link frm the soft link bc its a symbol to the file but we can access the original file form the hard copy
bc its a copy of the original file 


   CREATIG SHORTCUT /LINK TO FILES
Hard link : copy of a file (hard link starts with '_') just like a normal file 
ln fieName linkName
ln list.txt my list
hardlink maintains original file size  eg if original file size is 250, hardlink will also be 250


softlink: symbolic to the file ) short cut link to the file
ln-s filename linkname
ln -s new.txt mylist
*** soft link starts with  l & the file size is smaller compared to the original file 
eg, original file can be 250mb in size but softlink can be 5mb in size
