!= , is not 

********* WE HV 2 DEFAULT MODULES : Command module and setup module

httpd is a package manager for yum (redhat) while apache or debiem is a package manager for apt (ubuntu) linux

                             OPEN SSL
****** 1:35:30   its actually a better way to install openssl on your local env bc once u destroy your instance, it means ull hv to always be reintalling it but if you hv it
on your local env and you want to encrypt anything youcan just open openssl, u can use it to encrypt anything and you can send a PW or a key to someone then if they hv openssl 
they can decrypt it, they can use decrypt and get whatever info your trying to send 

*********** 1:37:22 you used sudo !! , was that to recall the previous command , in all cases
yes i want to recall the last command but am adding sudo to it, these are linux command which u guy shud hv done when u did linux, when u look at the short cuts in linux

58:16   *******we created the user in the control node but we had to ssh into the remote node(home of ansible to see the encryted PW of the user we created in /etc/shadow  ?


what command do you use to find your present working dir?  
ANS : pwd
now if i ask you to find your pwd, i dnt expect you to write a script, to put that inside of a script bc its a one line command, its a command that u can directly execute on
ur CLI
BUT if you have a multiple/series of commands that you want to execute then you can put them in a script 
so thats what an adhoc command is and we do that bc its smt that we dnt execute often 
adhoc command is a one line command and its smt we dnt execute often but if we hv multiplr command that we always run all the time then 
it is best practice to put multiple commands in a sript( **me,playbk) and its less prone to error and all the time you run the script, you are runing the same command so its
less prone to error if you execute it as a script as oppose to u typing 10 commands bk to bk on the cli, you are prone to make mistakes
so for one line you can run it directly on the cli but for multiple commands u put it in a script thats what automation is about 


so for ansible we hv adhoc commands but if we hv multiple commands that we want to pass tru ansible then we can write a play bk 

anytime we want to create a file , we use the file module
referring to video3 class33 ************ 1:05


***********13:06         ................ STARTS

               APPLYING THE CODE AGAIN LIKE FROM PREVIOUS CLASS

i hv my config files so ill 
trfrm init
tefrm validtae
terfrm apply
its now creating my instance   ( he probably destroyed evrything at the end of last class
just as we did the other time am goin to b able to ssh in to my insatnce which is my control node 
after sshing , i need to connect with ssh but i wnat to do it passwd less authentication so ill exchange a key
so this is the processwe already went tru and u shud be familiar with it now
you first provison ur instances and once evrytin has been installed , then we go ahead and create our ssh keys

output:
control server
ansible_publicip = 54.185.247.171
  instance private ip =[
"172.31.21.91"
"172.31.28.218"

 ********************** the host
inatance pub ip 
35.91.190.201
35.89.8.147

rhel private ip
172.31.21.92
public
50.112.62.228

18:30******* evryting has been created so we go into our host file 

so we first ssh into our that instance  (using the public ip): 54.185.247.171
after which we configure our host file
in aws click conncet, he copied the ssh command for the instance  54.185.247.171


19:23*******                                     STILL USING THE IDE
again am doing this still on my terminal (terfrm IDE) but hv already provisIoned dit in my vscode 
so i can stilluse my vscode to do it, and ill show you when we write playbks 


                                                STEPS TO SSHING INTO ANSIBLE SERVER
#### 1) 
but for now ill just ssh in 
splits his terminal
cd into downloads , where the key is , so that it finds the key
paste the command 
yes
now am in my instance 
so i caraeted a user called ansible
so ill 

####  2)
ubuntu@ip-172-31-28-203: $ sudo su - ansible 

now am in my ansible server
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ ansible all -m ping   ... .. said  he meant to type all but its seeing it that he wants to ping the group
provided host list is empty, only localhost is available 
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ ansible localhost -m ping 
success
now i can cd and config my host file 

##### 3)
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ vi /etc/ansible/host
and we see evrythin has been commanted 
so i need to now insert my host
i want to create 2grps just as we did it the other time    .......... 23:45
the grp could have 20 server, 50 servers
created db and web grp

so basically hes doing the same thing WE Already did in video2

#### 4)

to disable key host checking (we need to change to false)
                                                              GENERATING THE Ansible.cfg file
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $  vi /etc/ansible.cfg
as we see evrytin is commented out , it is bc evrytin is ruuning by default , they are default setting, default just means ansible config is in the etc/ansible  bt if u want 
to see the actual file run this command and it will generate for you your actual file ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $  ansible-conifg init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg
am using this to redirect, its going to overide evrything in the config file so the config file wil now hv content

ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $  vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg                       *but he didnt see the file so he ls
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $  ls
ansible.cfg                                          ****** ok it created it in my pwd 
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $  cat ansible.cfg
we see the configfile and most of the tins hv been commented




31:35 ****************************  FORKS 
we hv what is called forks
its like how many servers ansible can confiure at once ie in parrarrel


INTERVIEW QUSETION
can you configur your ansible so that it execute task on remote host in series , ie one host after another

ANS:
yes you can do that by setting your forks number to 1 so that ist only executing task on one SERVER AT A TIME 

bt right now by default its set to 5, so its able to configure 5servers at the same time, basically in parrarrel 

#************* by deafault keyhost checking has been set to true but now we hv to change it to false
so vi 
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $  vi ansible.cfg
and cahnge true to false

SO HOST KEY CHANGEHAS BEEN configured , so we wont be asked if i want to connect 

##### 5)
next
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $  ssh-keygen
key generated

ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ ssh-copy-id 172.31.21.91
password :ansible 
key added
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $  ssh-copy 172.31.28.28.218
key added
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ ssh-copy 172.21.92

so hv configured my remote hoste to be managed remotelessly
key 


38:21                  contd frm video2                         USING THE APT/YUM MODULE TO INSTALL PACKAGE MANAGERS
**************** back to ansible modules

6) (Apt)  yum Module

Used to install a package in the ansible client.
$ ansible db -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present" --become

$ ansible db -m service -a "name=apache2 state=started" --become

$ ansible db -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present" -b


                                              ROOT PRIVILEDGES   "-b"
41:05 ***** 

we need root priviledge to install a package  and  apt or yum will be used interchangeably  e.g yum for redhat and apt for ubuntu (debiem package manager) 
so we use a command called "become" to excalate our priviledges or a " -b " option , -b just means you wnat escalate the priviledges, we wnt to use sudo prividege

ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ $ ansible all -m yum -a "name=apache2 state=present" --b
failed for the first ubuntu server
failed for the 2nd ubuntu server
also failed for the redhat server     *********** bc it couldnt find apache tool


              TROUBLESHOOTING ; Apache not part of yum repo

*********  yes when we are working with yum module, apache tool is nt part of the yum repo, instead you need to install httpd 
httpd is the same package but its the package thats in the yum repository  bc were trying to install a package(apache) thats not part of yum repository
so bc of this now we hv to change our package 
but if i still want to install apache then apache is a package for the apt repository or dibiam 
$ ansible db -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present" --become
   this package is apcahe
but if am using yum i need to insatll httpd
$ ansible db -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" --become
   thats the package for yum 

  ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ $ ansible all -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present" -b
chnage is true
  succes for the first ubuntu server
change is true
success for the 2nd ubuntu server
But  failed for the redhat server  

####### 6iI)                                   
45:29
*************  *****************             IDEM POTENCY

if i run the caommand again  :
  ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ $ ansible all -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present" -b

chnage is false                              *********** this is because the package has already been installed & so, ansible will nt install it again
  succes for the first ubuntu server
change is false                                         ********* this is called idem potency
success for the 2nd ubuntu server
But  failed for the redhat server  



                                  REMOVING A PACKAGE
###  6iII)
***************************** ABSENT 
 to remove the package ill say state is absent 

  ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ $ ansible all -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=absent" -b

chnage is true                            ***********   pacakge has been removed 
  succes for the first ubuntu server
change is true                                       
success for the 2nd ubuntu server
But  failed for the redhat server  


*********** so now we see we can use yum or apt to install our packages


#### 6iV)
48:07 ************
                                    USING YUM 
to use yum , instead of all , ii use the grp name : web       ( we can use either present or latest)

  ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ $ ansible web -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -b      **** so it will instal httpd on yum on that particular grp &it wilinstall the lastest
it will check my web grp whic is redhat                                                      nd am using -b bc we are installing a package, we nid sudo priviledges

change =true                                                                                         

******** we installed using a yum module

********* so we hv apache(or he said package) module, apt module, yum module 
all these are ansible modules that you can use , modules are small programm that we are using 
all thses are package managers
we are using package mangers to be able to install package in our servers

48:42
***********
we can use a service module if we need to start our appl
we can install ngnix and we can start it by using a service module

#### 
   7) Service Module

You can use the service module to manage services running on the remote nodes managed by Ansible. This will require extended system privileges, so make sure your remote user
has sudo permissions and you include the --become option to use Ansible’s privilege escalation system. Using -K will prompt you to provide the sudo password for the 
connecting user.

$ ansible all -i inventory -m service -a "name=nginx state=restarted" --become -K

$ ansible all -m service -a "name=nginx state=stopped" --become -K

*********** lets install ngnix on our db group
installing ngnix using apt

  ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ $ ansible db -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present" -b
change = true          installed

now to start the service                 ************* we need sudo priviledge to start it  so "-b"  , its only admin who can start it
  ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ $ ansible db -m service -a "name=ngnix state=restarted" -b
change=true
state = started

53:20
on the other splited part of the terminal
terraform output
we see our output
he copied one of the public ip of the host and bc ngnix runs on port 80
35.91.190.201:80    in google
we see apache runing on that particualr ubuntu
so we hv used service module to start the service 
we can still use the service module to stop it 
  ********  
  ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ $ ansible db -m apt -a "name=nginx state=stopped" -b
now the service has been stopped

56:18

############ 8)

8) User Module
Used to create user accounts.  (TO create users, but you wil first craete an encrypted pW for the user)
Create a password encryption
Generate the password from your local environment
$ openssl passwd -crypt <desired_password>

$ ansible db -m user -a "name=Peter password=wiyiMQbLhCRUY shell=/bin/bash" -b

                                ENCRYPTION , SUDO !!
eg 
 ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ cat /etc/shadow
permission denied 
 ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ sudo !!
we see the list  of paswords
we see ansible pW was encrpted, so pW are stored as encrypted in /etc/shadow file

eg                         CREATING A uSER

 ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ openssl passwd -crypt mark
unknown                                                           ********** he said openssl isnt installed


************ he went to the other part of his terminal
(base) - terraform files openssl passwd -crypt mark                       ********* bc he has openssl insatlled here his local env, the other part is his ec2 instance
psv/alszgssq                                                       ***********i hv encrypted the PW n it has been genearated,this is the PW we need to pass as encrypted

*********** back on the other part of the terminal 
using the user module , i will craete the user in the db grp
 ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $   ansible db -m user -a "name=mark" password=psv/alszgssq shell=/bin/bash" -b
change=true                         ********   it has created a user mark
home : "/home/mark"                        created a home 
 password :                            NOT LOGGING PASSWORD            ******* so u cant use d encryted PW a sa login PW, what u nid to use is d decrypted PW(mark)
its saved in the/ etc/paswd thats why its encrypted

1:03:19
to see the encrypted PW , we need to ssh into one of the instances (so we left the control node)
psv/alszgssq   
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $  ssh 172.31.21.91
welcme to ubnuntu                                       ******* now in the home of ansible 
ansible@ip-172.32.21.91 :$ cat /etc/passwd
mark : /home/bin/bash
ansible@ip-172.32.21.91 :$  cat etc shadow 
permission denied
ansible@ip-172.32.21.91 :$  sudo !!
mark: psv/alszgssq                         encrypted but to login as mark , ill pass the PW as mark cos mark is the PW that we encrypted,
                                                 but when using an ansible playbk to craete a user u hv to encrypt d PW using openssl and then pass it 



####                           
9)   Setup module
This is a default module and is used to gather facts about the hosts.  egused to go to the host to gather facts, to find out wheter python has been installed, to find out
what package manager this server uses..... this is also a default module

The setup module returns detailed information about the remote systems managed by Ansible, also known as system facts.

To obtain the system facts for group1, run:

$ ansible group1 -m setup

This will print a large amount of JSON data containing details about the remote server environment.

To print only the most relevant information, include the "gather_subset=min" argument as follows:

$ ansible group1 -m setup -a "gather_subset=min"

To print only specific items of the JSON, you can use the filter argument. This will accept a wildcard pattern used to match strings. For example, to obtain information about both the ipv4 and ipv6 network interfaces, you can use ipv as filter:

$ ansible group1 -m setup -a "filter=ipv"


#########a)

ansible@ip-172.32.21.91 :$  exit                    the ****** host instance/ansible home to go bk to the contorl node
ansible@ip-172.31.28.203 :$ ansible web -m setup                    ****** it will return info abt this redhat server
success
there are lots of info it returns , its called gathering fact

1:7:50
*********eg 
ansible architecture" x86_64
some of the facts returned are like variables that can be accessesed and we wil see hw to do that


                             USING THE SETUP MODULE & VARIABLES
if i wanted to,i can use a variable to find the architecture of my server, i can use it as a filter
therfor i can use my setup module and call these variables
ill say if ansible architecture"  is  x86_64 , i can pass condition like that 
then ansible will go out bc of the setup module, it will look for servers or host that has this architecture and those are the servers that its going to perform  a task on  

also i can look at 
ansible _distribution : redhat                   ******** and we will be using this variables
i can say that i want to configure instances whose ansible distribution is redhat

eg                                        USING VARIABLES FOR APT/YUM MODULE
when i was running the command that we were installing httpd or apache, i would hv passed a variable and say install apache if ansible distribution is debiem bt install 
httpd if ansible distribution is erdhat 
so the satup module will go out and check all your servers then whatevr dustribution it returns if the distribution is redhat its goin to install httpd , if the distribution
is debiam it will install apache 
so thats hw u can use ansible with a setup module to automate process to dynamically hv it go an install packages based on the operating system, we wil see hw we can do that

*******there are lot of varaiables, key value pairs that you can reference based on what you want
you 

ansible os family, ansible pkg_mg , so you can use all these as variables to filter out what resource sor server you want to maintain or configure 


#########  b)
1:10:41              ***************


To print only the most relevant information, include the "gather_subset=min" argument as follows:

$ ansible group1 -m setup -a "gather_subset=min"


eg
ansible@ip-172.31.28.203: $ ansible web -m setup -a "gather_subset=min"
 so it wont print out evrytin , just the most inportant, like a summary of all the vraiables you  can use reference


                DISABLING SETUP MODULE
******** we can disable this setup madule by passing  a flag called gather facts = false 
we will see hw to do that in playbks 


          INTERVIEW QUESTION
when you  pass an option like :gather facts= to false what module are you disabling

ANS: 
You are diasbling the setup module



10)
###### Debug module
Executes only on the local host to display some information- message or variable value.

We do not need ssh connectivity or password for a debug module. When using the debug module, the arguments will either be
- msg = to display a message
- var = to display a variable

**Default variables**                             ******** these are some variables within ansible 
    - inventory_hostname
    - inventory_hostname_short
    - groups/ groups.keys()
$ ansible all -m debug -a "var='This is a debug module'"             ******** it wil perform d task on my ansible control node display the msg on my ansible control node 
$ ansible all -m debug -a "msg={{}}"                                 *** so am using a debug module for info so that i can get the info y bc if am printing smt like  a file
                                                                  or perfroming a task, its been performed on the remote host, bt if i want info i can use debug so that it
                                                              prints out info on my ansible control node and with that i can pass d arguments as either variable e.g 
inventory_hostname

You can use debug to display variables.
$ ansible all -m debug -a "var='inventory_hostname'"         ******* d eg, in quotation marks like this bc already this is a variable
$ ansible all -m debug -a "msg={{inventory_hostname}}"      **** bt i can pass d same tin using a msg argument bt it has to be in these brackets,bc its how we read variables

If you have an inventory with entries like 'server1.cloud.production.host' then the command below will return server1.
$ ansible all -m debug -a "msg={{inventory_hostname_short}}"

You can also use debug module to display groups or groups keys in your inventory.
$ ansible all -m debug -a "var='groups'"
$ ansible all -m debug -a "var='groups.keys()'"


###### a)
*********   1:15:26
eg
 inventory hostname of  db host group

ansible@ip-172.31.28.203: $   $ ansible db -m debug -a "var='inventory_hostname'"                  ***** am specifying this is a variable

ineventory hostname : 172.31.21.91                 ******* on my db the iventory hostname are theese two 
success
ineventory hostname : 172.31.28.218               ***** bc its a debug module ,it will return this info

ansible@ip-172.31.28.203: $    ansible db -m debug -a "gather_subnet=min'"              ******* 1:18:13
we see a lot of variables like when we ran setup module

******* dnt knw why its saying vaiable not defined , well thats how u use  a variable  but if you are pasing it as a msg put it in bracket/calibras

ansible@ip-172.31.28.203: $   ansible db -m debug -a "msg={{inventory_hostname}}"      
success
msg: 172.31.21.91
succes 
msg:    172.31.28.203             ***** we see the key word msg ,the key is msg

*** so all these varaiables are been read using our debug module and its displaying info on our system, inventory hostanme is been displayed as a msg

so thats how we use debug module
as we go further we ll see hw we can this debug


### b)
********** 

TO KNOW THE GROUPS I HAVE 

$ ansible all -m debug -a "var='groups'"


###  c)
********* 
  to know the keys i have 
i can pass it as a msg or a variable 


ansible@ip-172.31.28.203: $ ansible db -m debug -a "msg='groups.keys()'"
  172.31.21.91 success
  msg: 
   all
ungrouped
   db
  web                                     **** so these are the grps that i hv in my invenory

172.31.28.218 success
  msg: 
   all
ungrouped
   db
  web     
                              so am using a degug to read my inventory and the variables that are defined inside of my inventory and these variables are been retuned as grp


********* these are some of the basic modules that w eneed to knw , bt again as we lookde, ANSIBLE has a ton of modules that are there, public modules taht are there that
you can use 



###### complaint
am trying to run the openssl its nt working, i copied the command diresctly frm the scripte

ANS
OK dnt copy, type it bc atimes the operator may see it as smt different

i typed it the same thing
ok , tyr it on your gitbash, bc the most imp thing iS that you just want to encrypt the PW 


   QUESTION
1) when u did the ssg ken gen, you configured for 3servers, what if you want to do it for 50 servers , is that what you will do for all 50?
also when you created a user you first created a PW, but to do it for 50 users, is ther a way to do it in bulk

ANS:
you can hv a script that can loop tru your invnetory , bt ryt now we v been do in it maunally bc we nid to understand the concept, bt as we go further Tomao we wil look at 
dynamic inventories if i hv 50servers ders no way ill go into the 50 serevers to get the inventories, the i[p addresses  so i can configure it, with dynamic invnetory, i 
dnt need to configure my host file, instaed ill use a script taht wil go into aws , even if its 100servers, based on the script am using it goes and and get all the servers
ips and return it as an inventories then ansible will just use that as an inventory to go and do your configuration

but what ull do here, esp in your prod env goin forward, most companies wil use what is called custom AMIs, ie an AMI that hv created bc am using it for a coy, this AMI will
be managed by ansible b4 i craete the AMAI, i already exchange the key i pass in the key, the ssh key, you load it with all the software b4 you craete an instance for it
so when i introduce ansible to mg8 it i dnt nid to worry abt ssh keys anymore bc this custome AMI alraedy has a user called ansible baked in, a pecific key has already been 
exchanged so my ansible usser is already set so ill create ec2 instances based on this AMi, i can spin up a 100 instances based on this AMi.when i use that AMI , it will 
already hv been configured to be maintained by ansible but if i just hv insatnces that exists in aws then we ll see hw i can use dynamic inventory script that wil go into aws 
search tru d region, get all d inastnces and return that as an inventory then ansible wil use the ip addreses and go out and just do configuration.

*** 1:43:20
then for users, u can use loops , loop tru instances, if i hv maultiple packages that i need to install, i can use like foreloops that will loop tru all the variables that i 
hv, it will loop tru all the packages and one by one & those wil be installed & the same thing again for users,we can set a foreloop so that it  loops tru all our inventories
and for each server its configuring a user

as we go tru play bks and roles then things will start to mk more sense bt now we are focusing on the conept and the basics of hw actually things works

                                               ANSIBLE PLAYBOOKS (are written in YAML) task run frm top to bottom

   ie, hv captured it as a code so am able to reuse it , this an eg of having infrasture,conifguration as a code,i hv my playbk wher i hv my configuration n i can reuse it
so if you need to execute a task with ansible more than once then write a playbk bt if its just one task you can use an ahod command 

***********  Ansible Playbooks offer a repeatable, re-usable,simple configuration management and multi-machine deployment system,one that is well suited to deploying 
complex applications.

If you need to execute a task with Ansible more than once, write a playbook and put it under source control. Then you can use the playbook to push out new configuration or 
confirm the configuration of remote systems.

Playbooks can:
declare configurations
orchestrate steps of any manual ordered process, on multiple sets of machines, in a defined order
launch tasks synchronously or asynchronously
Playbooks record and execute Ansible’s configuration, deployment, and orchestration functions.

They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT process.
If Ansible modules are the tools in your workshop, playbooks are your instruction manuals,(ie playbk gives ansible the instruction on what to do) and your inventory of hosts
are your raw material.  (ie these instructions always happens on your inventory, on the host that u hv defined )

At a basic level, playbooks can be used to manage configurations of and deployments to remote machines. At a more advanced level, they can sequence multi-tier rollouts 
involving rolling updates, and can delegate actions to other hosts, interacting with monitoring servers and load balancers along the way.

Playbooks are designed to be human-readable and are developed in a basic text language. There are multiple ways to organize playbooks and the files they include.


###
11a)
  Playbook syntax

Playbooks are expressed in YAML format with a minimum of syntax.
A playbook is composed of one or more ‘plays’ in an ordered list.
The terms ‘playbook’ and ‘play’ are sports analogies. Each play executes part of the overall goal of the playbook, running one or more tasks. Each task calls an Ansible
module.
A playbook runs in order from top to bottom. Within each play, tasks also run in order from top to bottom.
Playbooks with multiple ‘plays’ can orchestrate multi-machine deployments, running one play on your webservers, then another play on your database servers, then a third play
on your network infrastructure, and so on. (ie if u hv multiple play u can hv dif target, one play targeting db instances, the other web instances bc each play wil hv diff
arguments, it will v a host and it will hv task   *********** 1:53:20

At a minimum, each play defines two things:
the managed nodes to target, using a pattern
at least one task to execute (and this task wil hv  a module, ie what are you trying to do in this particular node) 


ie, so a playbk can hv multiple play, evry play wil hv some task, task will use a module, each task calls a module, task belongs to a play, a play belongs to a playbk, so i
can hv a playbk with 5plays then this diff plays are executing task on diff host bt those task each of them wil be calling  a module 

                                      INTERVIEW QUESTION
1) What programming lang can you write???
   
ANS:     YAML
when you writing playbk, its written in yaml so ull hv an experience writing YAML language

 2) whats the diffERNECES btw ansible and terfrm 
ANS:

ansible wil run frm top to bottom, that concept we say that ansible is procedural , it follows a certain procedure ,frm top to bottom so you hv to order the task 
so when a task fails ansible will stop, if it encounters smt that fails your play will stop and it will stop right der bc it runs frm top to bottom

whereas
terrafrm is declarative, is nt procedural, it doesnt matter hw the files are organized, doesnt matter hw u put the mainfest files in a dir, bc ist declarative, it will read
everytin firt then create  a plan , so it doesn tmatter the order of the files 
thats one of the key differences when it comes to our automation tools


1:53:52

####
11b)
  Ansible task execution

By default, Ansible executes each task in order, one at a time, against all machines matched by the host pattern.

Each task executes a module with specific arguments. When a task has executed on all target machines, Ansible moves on to the next task.

When you run a playbook, Ansible returns information about connections,the name lines of all your plays and tasks, whether each task has succeeded or failed on each machine,
and whether each task has made a change on each machine.

At the bottom of the playbook execution, Ansible provides a summary of the nodes that were targeted and how they performed.

General failures and fatal “unreachable” communication attempts are kept separate in the counts.

Desired state and ‘idempotency’
                                         eg, i wnated to install httpd or apsche, once hv installed it bc i ran a command then that was my desired state
Most Ansible modules check whether the desired final state has already been achieved, and exit without performing any actions if that state has been achieved, so that 
repeating the task does not change the final state.

Modules that behave this way are often called ‘idempotent.’ Whether you run a playbook once, or multiple times, the outcome should be the same.


11c)
#####

Yaml basics

For Ansible, nearly every YAML file starts with a list.
Each item in the list is a list of key/value pairs, commonly called a “hash” or a “dictionary”.
So, we need to know how to write lists and dictionaries in YAML.
All YAML files can optionally begin with --- and end with ... . This is part of the YAML format and indicates the start and end of a document.
All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a "- " (a dash and a space):


example:
         a list always has "-"
 ---
# A list of tasty fruits - Apple
  - Orange
  - Strawberry
  - Mango
...


11d)
#######

A dictionary is represented in a simple key: value form (the colon must be followed by a space):
# An employee record martin:
  name: Martin D'vloper 
  job: Developer
  skill: Elite

2:00:28                                                REMOTE DEVELOPMENT
****************** 
TO STARt writing our playbk lets go to our vscode

  so this is my vscode that i have configured,my configured file  already has my ansible host name and my key
so i want to do what is called remote development
so bc it has already been configured like this , now again you dnt have to use that automation that we did
******** 2:00:05
all you hv to do is copy, go into your configure file and just add this  :
host ansible                                         2:03:29******* this is what will be used for ssh configuration
   HostName: 54:185:247:171
   user:    ansible
   identifyfile: ~?downloads/elks-instance.pem

 ull need to run this script in the link below, once you login in, you will need to follow this procedure here bc if u do jst the config above, ansible wil nt own the home
the home will stilll be owned by root, so you can ssh into your ansible control machine
https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/Ansible-mc-series/blob/main/02-Configuring%20managed%20nodes/remote-config.md

2:03:00
***** anisble has to own the authorized keys:      $ sudo chown ansible:ansible authorized_keys
also the /etc/ansible , if it deosnt , ansible wont hv right to write to this dir 
 $ sudo chown -R ansible:ansible /etc/ansible

**** you can fo;;ow the script if the automated way isnt working for you bt if its working then its easier bc its just configuring that 

####
12a)

2:04:00
********* so now in my vscode , click connect to host which is ansible
are you sure you want to continue :yes
i can open , and am opening it in the home of ansible dir  /home/ansible/
am now in the home of ansible
i hv my ansible config file that i created
now in the home of ansible, i can create a dir, call it ansible
if i open a new terminal, ill see i hv a dir called ansible

ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: ls
ansible ansible.cfg
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: cd ansible
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: git clone https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/Ansible-mc-series.git

##
12b)

cloning my entire ansible series      ***** watch 2:07:00
now if i go to my ansible dir illl see that i hv all these one of whcih is my dir called palybooks
so inside of the playbks, i can open my simple playbooks and i can see my first play , 
if i open it,it will open for me right here and am able to do my editing right here
 we can cd into our directories and run our plays from here
but b4 we do that lets learn how to write a simple playbk

2:08:20
***** he said Emeka made some changes on that , can yous end that script to everyone for those using windows, Emeka made modification on the script it is going work for you..

##
12c)

2:08:50                
**********
ill create anoda dir inside of this dir, ill call it testing
it wasnt working on th up part of the vscode 
HE Just deccide to do it on the vscode terminal
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: cd 
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: mkdir testing
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: cd testing       
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings

he left the twminal and went on bk on the up part of the vscode  and created:  testing.yaml                ********** now craete this file/playbk inside of the testing dir 
we are writing a yaml file so the extension has to be YAML

now we are in the yaml file 

###
13)
                   **** 2:11:00     this is hw to write a playbook                ***** ******* (watch, although i wrote evryin out)
https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/Ansible-mc-series/blob/main/05-Playbooks/playbook.md

if  i have an adhoc command like this  :ansible db -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present" -b
we are installling apache
i can rewrite this command into a playbk

first start with 3 , ---

  ---
 - hosts: db                                     ***** these are my host, in my hostfile i hv group called db
   tasks:                                         ******* bc i can put multiple task, its a list of task, i can pass alist of task
   - apt: name=apache2 state=present              *******  every task will hv a module , n for this task am using an apt module , apache2
     become: yes                                   *******  this play bc we knw we are installing a package we hv to use sudo , become=yes


so hv written a play without a name , hv jsut wirtten it like that, 


###
13a)

               To run ansible playbook
        ansible playbook-i inventory_file playbook.yaml

******** back to vscode terminal:

ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings ls
testing.yaml
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings ansible-playbook test.yaml
******* when you look at this playbk, we are not passing any inventory, our default inventory is in the host, thas the default so bc we already hv a default, we dnt nid to
pass a -i option , bt if we hv a custom inventory then we ll pass a - i, to tell ansible we hv anoda inventory so dnt use the host file bt bc our inventory is in the host 
file and we hv a grp called db we ll nt specify -i, instaed we ll reference our playbk

ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings ansible-playbook test.yaml

PLAY db (gathering facts)
ok:172.31.28.218
ok:172.31.21.91

TASK (apt)
changed: 72.31.28.218
changed: 172.31.21.91



PLAY RECAP


######## 13b)

Explaining the result     .....  2:17:00

the play is jsut showing db, 
then we only passed just one task apt but in the result we hv 2task that ran
the 1st task is named as gathering facts, its your setup module
remember we said default module, your setup module will run to gather facts
it has gone to the inventory, it has found that the db grp ha sthese 2instances , these aour inventories
so it has gathered facts, it has found out facts abt these

then it has ran our task, this task is just called apt" bt this is nt the name , its just written apt 
then we see changed ie has has installed our apache

then it gives us a summary ie the RECAP

********* we had 2task but one is the default task, which was gathering facts 
so we see it was able to run

####
13C)
                                            MODIFYING THE PLAYBK
********  2:18:19
for this particular play, our playbk  here doesnt have a name but we can modify it so we give it a name

    ---
 - name: Install apache2            ******** name for our playbook
   hosts: db
   tasks:
   - name: apache2                       ********* name for our task
     apt:
        name: apache2
        state: absent
     become: yes                      **** become has to be on the same line as apt bc its nt a child of the module, its part of the module


******* this is the same playbook bt hv given a name to my task and playbook
bt bc this has alreday been installed, let me change, let me say state is absent and re run the play

ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings ansible-playbook test.yaml
so our playbk ran but apache was uninstalled bc the state is absent
and it ran from top to bottom

   
 2:24:14
######
13D)          
*******************       DISABLING MODULE


---
 - name: Install apache2
   hosts: db
   gather_facts: false              ***** thatis do not run the setup module
   tasks:
   - name: apache2
     apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
     become: yes

******* run the ansible playbk again 

ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings ansible-playbook test.yaml

PLAY db (install apache)

TASK (apache2)
ok: 72.31.28.218
ok: 172.31.21.91


PLAY RECAP


***************  now  it just runs the play and then goes straight to the task which is apache
its skipping my gather facts
so this is hw you disable your setup module by passing gather fact to false

******* but as we will see later when it comes to automation u wnat to use the setup module bc if u diasble it u might nt be able to get acces to some sys variable that you 
may want to use for automation

######## ill just enable it back here to true


#### 13e)
*********** 2:23:55
lets say after installing this i want to use another module to start it , so i can add anoda task and i has to be n the same lavel/line with the previous task


   A service module can also be included to start apache with become on task level as follows;
---
 - name: Install apache2
   hosts: db
   tasks:
   - name: install apache2
     apt:
        name: apache2
        state: absent
     become: yes
   - name: start apache2
     service:
       name: apache2
       state: started
     become: yes


************ this playbk will fail  bc, state is absent, task start apache2 will fail bc , task apache2 is absent , bc its unable to start apache service
so for the task to succeed we need to change state to present then it will gather facts ,install apache then use a service module to start it, then d 3 tasks will be success
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings ansible-playbook test.yaml


PLAY db (gathering facts)
ok:172.31.28.218
ok:172.31.21.91

TASK (apache2)
changed: 72.31.28.218
changed: 172.31.21.91

TASK (start apache2)
failed

PLAY RECAP
failed 


###                                using  become on a host
13f)

************** to reduce lines of code instead of passing become twice, on a task level (13e) thereby duplicating it , if all my task require sudo rights then i can pass it
on a host level 

You can use become on a host level as shown below;
---
 - name: Install apache2
   hosts: db
   become: yes                             ******** (can use true or yes)
   tasks:
   - name: install apache2
     apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
   - name: start apache2
     service:
       name: apache2
       state: started

************ , bc its now at a host level, all tasks are running with sudo right, priviledge excalation bc become has been passed on a host level rather than having to pass
becomes for each the several tasks we hv


***** so this is how you can write a basic playbook

 2:31:46                                    EXPLAINING MORE PLAYBOOKS
###########
13g)
inside of our playbooks here ILL Just walk you through  (first play.yml)
******** 2:32:12

   - hosts: localhost                              ********* the host is just a localhost
   tasks:
   - debug:                                         ******** using a debug msg to display a msg
      msg: 'This is the day'
...

#####
13h)
******* so inside this ansible dir, i have multiple playbooks,  to install like httpd on a web repo 

#ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -b
---
 - name: httpd
   hosts: web
   become: yes
   tasks:
   - name: Install httpd
     yum:
       name: httpd
       state: present
   - name: Start httpd
     service:
       name: httpd
       state: started

so ill cd 

ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings cd
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings cd ansible/
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings ls
Ansible-mc-series
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings cd ansible-mc -series/o5-playbooks/01-simple-playbooks/
so i hv this httpd.yml which i want to insatll on my web which is my redhat, if i want to install on my redhat, then am insatlling httpd using yum
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings ansible-playbook httpd.yml
now it will gather facst,
it will find a grp called web
it has installed it and started it cos am using the service to  start it 


2:34:25
### 13i)

Another file, again all these are just sample palybooks 
lets say i wnat change a line inside of a file

---

i need to capture that info inside of a variable called results, am using the key word register meaning its goin to capture the info once it runs that bc if i run it as a
playbk its nt goin to display the info for me here bc the module wil just do the work and it just gives me a summary that everythin has been changed bt if i wan to see d 
result then i need to capture those result using what is called a register and am capturing it in a variable called result then i us ethe debug module to display that result

  ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings ansible-playbook uptime.yml
now i see the memory info  thats the task that ran 
TASK [memeory info]
changed [local host]

********* but if i  didnt use register it will just show that it changed, it did smt
so if i wantit displayed to me i need to capture it using a register, i need to reg in a variable and am using debug to display it bc its my local host so debug module will
display that register, the result that i captured in that task and now giving me what my memeory info is for my instance

****** so that is the uptime and httpd.yml

ill run it now with my setup as false

******* bc hv disabled gather facts its telling me the conditional check ansible distribution failed (in my understanding, the condition is relying on the gathered facts  
the nasible distributionos bc it failed the condition couldnt execute)
error while evaluating the distribution
ansible distribution is undefined

* so i hv an error bc the ansible distribution is undefined bc i hv disabled the setup module , ie gather facts

########## i change gather facts now to true or comment it out, ie its the default module that wil run to gather my facts

   ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings ansible-playbook install_httpd.yml

PLAY RECAP



  ******* first task, to install httpd, it skipping bc it gathered facts on all 3servers bt found out that the 1st 2 are ubuntu , therfrore the task skipped it only 
installed on what is nt ubuntu which is redhat 

for the 2nd task, it did the reseverse


****** so i can see i can automate the process, i can use conditions, and am using conditions bc of the inbuilt variables which already exists, and am getting the variables 
using my setup module, am able to read the variables then made conditions based on the variables & am able to install packages just based on the distribution
this process has been automated

**** so this is how you can use conditions
and you can build in more logics so that ansible will use the logics you build in to mk decisions on wheter to install a package or not

why the script failed to run bc gather script was false and so it failed)


but if i was to use gather facts then this is how short my playbk will be bc it will find the facts for me and i dnt need to run any commands, i can just use a debug module

#########  lets looks at handlers


2:52:00                          ********** this needs to be xplained again
   INTERVIEW QUESTION
the first playbook that i ran to install httpd, we see that we we installed httpd then we started it, 
now the 2task are dependent on each other , installation had to be executed before "start" is executed, if the first state is absent the 2nd task will fail 
so bc the task are dependent on each other then we can create dependencies, ansible gives you a way of creating dependencies btw task & for the dependencies we can use handlers


###########
     13n)        WHAT ARE HANDLERS
these are just like ordinary task but the diff is handlers are only executed when notified, when there is a change 

---
  - hosts: localhost
    gather_facts: false
    become: yes
    tasks:
      - name: Install httpd
        yum:
          name: httpd
          state: present
      - name: start httpd
        service:
          name: httpd
          state: started

---
  - hosts: web
    gather_facts: false
    become: yes
    tasks:                               **********     whenevre you hv a change in this task it wil trigger the handle
      - name: Install httpd
        yum:
          name: httpd
          state: present
        notify:                                     ******* in the former task ill passa notifier/ notify & i also need to pass the name, what is this task notifying
          - start httpd                                    ***** its notifying the name of the handler: start httpd
    handlers:                                   ****** instead of putting 2nd task as a task, ill put a handler/s 
      - name: start httpd                         ********** i need to pass a name for the httpd and here its start httpd 
        service:
          name: httpd
          state: started      

****   i need to pass a name for the httpd and here its start httpd, instead of putting 2nd task as a task, ill put a handler/s, in the former task ill passa notifier/ 
notify & i also need to pass the name, what is this task notifying?? its notifying the name of the handler: start httpd, so the 2names must be the same, so the notifier
notifies the handler , this happens whenevre you hv a change in this task it wil trigger the handler if ders no change in the task the handler wont be triggerd

so if am installing httpd, it means that ill record a change in this, if thers a change in this then the handler has to be triggered to start it, if i havent changed this:
- start httpd , then this :  state: started, shudnt be trigerred, so now am creating dependencies as oppose to this(the first part) & i think also 13e above, when these are
are independent task, they are depending in a way bc for the httpd to start depends on the service but the 2tasks are running indenpendently, there is
nothing that is creating a dependency to them 
now that we knw that the first part was for demo, i can remove it 

******* 2:55:20

     ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/testings cd../06-handlers/

ok:[172.31.21.92]
PLAY RECAP  ........................

     **** bc ther was no need to install it the handler was not notified

############ but if i change the install to absent , httpd will be removed and bc this will record a change then the handler will be notified bt when its notified to start it
httpd has been remove therfore the handler will fail

       ansible@ip-172-31-28-203:~/ansible/ansible-mc-series/05-playbooks/06-handlers  ansible-playbook handlers.yml

RUNNING HANDLER: failed
PLAY RECAP  ....... failed

********** handler failed bc it wa snotified  to start bt httpd wa semove 
so anything thers a change in the task, it wil notify the handler

so this is how you can easily create dependencies where by only when you have changes

#if i change the task state to:  present and run it , it will insatll it and notify the handler and it will start it 
 right now w ehad 2task that ran 

   PLAY [WEB]
TASK [installed httpd]             
changed:[172.31.21.92]
RUNNING HANDLER: changed
PLAY RECAP  ....... ok


###### but if i re run the play 
bc there wont be  a change in the 1st task so the handler willl nt be notifed
PLAY [WEB]
TASK [installed httpd]             
changed:[172.31.21.92]
PLAY RECAP  ....... ok

***** so this is how handlers work , only work when notified and thats hw we create depencies btw task, you can use an handler 



###                TEMPLATE MODULE 

13o)

if i wanted to install the httpd 

3:01:01

when you use a copy module, it basically mean we are just copying  a file frm my local hostor ansible host and am copying it to a remote host 
so i can use copy module bt it only copy static data, ie the file does nt change at the point of execution
whenever a file doesnt change it means the file doesnt have variables that will be dynamically changed like ansible needs to read a variable when its copying that file
 so copy module is only used on ststic, a file does not change bt if a file has a variable that needs to be read at runtime then copy module will fail thats why we will
use a template module 

#########  so we use template module when you are copying the dynamic files, file that change, meaining a file that has a variable that run 
eg
  am missing a file , (ginger2, right here)
bt if i can just show you an example , if i was installing tomcat

               redirectPort="8443" />

   
3:06:00
*********** where is the tomcat port configured inside of my tomcat??
so i need to find out where this tomcat is actually configured so inside of my tomcat i hv  what we call the server.xml  
so i can copy a server.xml frm a tomacat
when i look at the particular server.xml
when i open the file and scroll up thers what is called a connector port , this is your tomcat port where that runs
but by default here it will just hv 8080  but i want to dynamically change the port so am passing this tomcat port as a variable 
so hv copied this sever.xml file and bc its a variable its a ginger2, this is ginger2 templating bc this one becomes as a template
so your file needs to end with a .j2 which is the extention for ginger templating so bc am using this server.xml as a template
********
its a template bc i hv a variable that will only be read when the playbk is running so this becomes a dynamic file, so i cant use a copy module to copy this bc a copy
module will nt be able to interpolate the value , 
copy module will just copy the file as it is and just transfer it bt bc i want to dynamically read values as the file is been copied then ill use a template module 
(install_tomcat.yml)

***** so for this template module am installing tomcat bt i hv to replace, i hv to get this file server.xml and i need to replace it in the confg dir cos thats wher that
server.xml is                ******* i bliv the 2 files is the server.xml & the dynamic file (ginger) we now hv inside the server.xml file , the giner is an xtension file
so what am doing is that am just replacing the file ,i hv an exact copy of the file but am using a template to go and replace those 2files bc when it replaces it, it wil 
replace it with this file( install_tomcat.yml) that has a diff port bc am pasing my tomcat port as a variable that is now goin to be passed inside of the server.xml file 
and now that port insid eof the instance will be 8095,instaed of 8090 ,so am using this template module to be able to install  tomcat so everything has been passed as 
variables so am able to mange variables in one location just by declaring vars: there ,then once that is declared
this is the tomcat url that hv also passed as a varaible, bc in the download part (using get url,) am just calling the tomcat url as a variable and its replacing the REQ 
tomact version 


******** lets run this playbk
it might tk a while bc am updating everything java 
as we go forth, we see that we hv a project that will go in replce the user, change the PW and setup the users and all the formations 

     ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: ~ cd ansible/ansible-mc-series/05-playbooks/04-template\module/
     ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: ~ / ansible/ansible-mc-series/05-playbooks/04-template\module/ $ ansible-playbook install_tomcat.yml

3:12:42 ..........................
its goin to tk a while to 
the firts task to updta erepoitory using yum
then install the Req JAVA
set the default java
then download tomcat
when it downloads it its going to unarchive it , all this is a module 

3:13:48
this will take a while to install tomcat
but we are now using this playbk to run that 
but as we wil see tomao thers now an even easy way of doing this bc now you can create a role and you can call the role whenevr u need them so youcan breakup this playbk
into multiple task like bc this is to start,we can pass this as an handler:

   - name: Starting tomcat
        shell:  nohup /usr/local/latest/bin/startup.sh &

******* we can pass this the template part inside of our template then the rest we can leave them as task                    

 ******** then all the variables we can put them inside the variable dir or variable file then once that role has been created then we just able to call nad reuse that 
particular role


    **** its updating repository, that takes a while 

3:15:37 *********** 
we can look at variables   , working_with_vars_yml

when you are working with variable, you just have to specify the variables by using the keyword vars:
you can pass your variable here

the when you want to reference them ur just using the double calibrases and that will call the specify variable 
but you can also put the variable inside of seperate file as we will see



##############     input_output .yml

  if i wnat my playbk to run but with user input then am goin to set what is called prompt 

   private = no       *** this means if when i type the name it will show , but if its a PW 
 private =yes          ******** then it is going to be hidden 


  ****** then 
  tasks:
   - debug:
      msg: "The username is: {{user_name}} and password is: {{password}}" 

       *********  am using the debug bc i pased these prompt as variable so my username has now become a prompt variable 
so am saying the username is  {{user_name}} and password is: {{password}}" 
bc hv passed them as vars_prompt, so evryting here becomes a varaible bc hv used the keyword var 

   ******* so thats how you can use inputs and i can use debug to output those specify variables

                                            LOOPS    ( without_loop.yml)

Loops is very imp, without it if you are given 
if i want to install packages, i wnt to insatll wget

######################################################################
it has replaced the tomcat but its not found
we will need to get the url for the tomcat
that url doesnt exists thats why its failing, failing to download 
but basically that playbk once you look at it, update the url, it is goin to install tomcat for you
###########################################################################################################



  i wnat to install pip, tree, vim,
if i hv more packages, it just means ill just keep writing but this becomes a very long playbk
so instaed of writing all these long lines of code, i can use a loop, 
 
        ********    loops.yml
            in this loop am just saying
   ---
  - hosts: web
    gather_facts: false
    become: yes
    tasks:
    - apt:                     ******* am using apt
       name: "{{item}}"              ******** and the name is , am passing here as a variable called item (i guess the callibres)
       state: present                   ****** present 
      loop:                                ******* then once i pass the loop, it is goin to loop tru these items, these will be called items 
          - git                                        and for evry item, it will be installed.
          - wget
          - pip3
          - tree
          - vim

****** so i can use a loop and just use list my items like this bt the name of the thing swe wnt to install is called an item, so it will be looping , eg
the first time the item is git it will be replaced in the calibres, it continues until all are installed

        ********** he ran the files but they failed 

 (loops.yml)
3:27:26 ******* success 
he had to change apt to yum to insatll on web 


  **** tomao we will go tru (using import and include) thers a reason i skipped it 
bc when we will be talking abt roles this is wher we  will be using how you can import a role or how you can include a role and what are the diff
we ll look at asnible roles and dynamic inventory 


    QUESTION
1) you said playbook is procedural  so is it realy necesssary  for us to use handler to notify the next process if it would run anyway??

    ANS: 
Yes, as we look at what handlers do, they only run when notifed bc if lets say ders no change in the httpd, its already running, ders no need to run this task (handler part
so ansible shud just go ahead and run the nxt play, ders no need to run this task if its nt necessary so this is just a way of cleaning up our playbk so that task only runs
when necessary and therfore handlers is a way of doin that, creating depencendies btw task and they will run run if they are notified, if there is a change then handler is
notified if ders no change then thers no need for it to run 



### just go over playbooks bc this is the really key of ansible, ie you knowing how to write  a playbk and executing using the diff modules
and if you go to interview you can say that you hv experience, you use diff modules to do config 
you v used like cariable to craete conditions so u are able to write a playbk that if you hv a fleet of 100instances but some of them windows and some are linux bt u just 
want to patch ununtu servers or you hv multiple patches for ubuntu , windows and redhat, so you can hv a playbk that uses condition it says 
if its a windows server then this is the patch ur to apply and vice versa, then your using the same playbk but with conditions then ur just running one playbk and ansible is
goin out into all your servers and bc of the gathering facts, it finds out on its own which server is what,if its windows then it applies the appriopriate patch vice versa
thats what automation is then u dnt hv to be logging into servers, this is my windows then running commands there

so as an engr, you sit bk tk your coffee and let ansible do the work for you  but the task is you to understand how to write the playbk, how to create the conditions , hw to
create depencies, when to run what, you can automate so that it runs on a schedule and those things are now like some advanced concept of ansible 
by the end of your bootcamp then u guys wll be expect in automation, now combining terfrm and ansible
