what command do you use to find your present working dir?  
ANS : pwd
now if i ask you to find your pwd, i dnt expect you to write a script, to put that insid eof a script bc its a one line command, its a command that u can directly execute on ur CLI
BUT if you have a multiple/series of commands that you want to execute then you can put them in a script 
so thats what an adhoc command is and we do that bc its smt that we dnt execute often 
adhoc command is a one line command and its smt we dnt execute often but if we hv multiplr command that we always run all the time then 
it is best practice to put multiple commands in a sript and  its less prone to error and all the time you run the script, you are runing the same command so its less prone to
error if you execute it as a script as oppose to u typing 10 commands bk to bk on the cli, you are prone to make mistakes
so for one line you can run it directly on the cli but for multiple commands u put it in a script thats waht automation is about 


so for ansible w ehv adhoc commands but if we hv multiple commands that we want to pass tru ansible then we can write a play bk 

anytime we want to create a file , we use the file module

just as we did the other time am goin to b able to ssh in to my insatnce which is my control node 
after sshing , i need to connect with ssh but i wnat to do it passwd less authentication so ill exchange a key
so this is the processwe already went tru and u shud be familiar with it now
you first provison ur instances and once evrytin has been installed , then we go ahead and create our ssh keys
