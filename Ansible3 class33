what command do you use to find your present working dir?  
ANS : pwd
now if i ask you to find your pwd, i dnt expect you to write a script, to put that insid eof a script bc its a one line command, its a command that u can directly execute on ur CLI
BUT if you have a multiple/series of commands that you want to execute then you can put them in a script 
so thats what an adhoc command is and we do that bc its smt that we dnt execute often 
adhoc command is a one line command and its smt we dnt execute often but if we hv multiplr command that we always run all the time then 
it is best practice to put multiple commands in a sript and  its less prone to error and all the time you run the script, you are runing the same command so its less prone to
error if you execute it as a script as oppose to u typing 10 commands bk to bk on the cli, you are prone to make mistakes
so for one line you can run it directly on the cli but for multiple commands u put it in a script thats waht automation is about 


so for ansible w ehv adhoc commands but if we hv multiple commands that we want to pass tru ansible then we can write a play bk 

anytime we want to create a file , we use the file module

i hv my config files so ill 
trfrm init
tefrm validtae
terfrm apply
its now creating my instance   ( he probably destroyed evrything at the end of last class
just as we did the other time am goin to b able to ssh in to my insatnce which is my control node 
after sshing , i need to connect with ssh but i wnat to do it passwd less authentication so ill exchange a key
so this is the processwe already went tru and u shud be familiar with it now
you first provison ur instances and once evrytin has been installed , then we go ahead and create our ssh keys

output:
control server
ansible_publicip = 54.185.247.171
  instance private ip =[
"172.31.21.91"
"172.31.28.218"

 ********************** the host
inatance pub ip 
35.91.190.201
35.89.8.147

rhel private ip
172.31.21.92
public
50.112.62.228

18:30******* evryting has been created so we go into our host file 

so we first ssh into our that instance  (using the public ip): 54.185.247.171
after which we configure our host file
in aws click conncet, he copied the ssh command for the instance  54.185.247.171

19:23******* 
again am doing this still on my terminal (terfrm IDE) but hv already provisIoned dit in my vscode 
so i can stilluse my vscode to do it, and ill show you when we write playbks 

but for now ill just ssh in 
splits his terminal
cd into downloads , where the key is , so that it finds the key
paste the command 
yes
now am in my instance 
so i caraeted a user called ansible
so ill 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-28-203: $ sudo su - ansible 

now am in my ansible server
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ ansible aa -m ping   ... .. said  he meant to type all but its seeing it that he wants to ping the group
provided host list is empty, only localhost is available 
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ ansible localhost -m ping 
success
now i can cd and config my host file 
ansible@ip-172-31-28-203: $ vi /etc/ansible/host
and we see evrythin has been commanted 
so i need to now insert my host
i want to create 2grps just as we did it the other time    .......... 23:45
