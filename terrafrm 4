RECAP , PROVISIONERS AND BACKENDSRECAP,


what is meta data ??

tefrm gives you what are called mata arguments
these are arguments that alter the normal behaviur of our resources 
by default resources that we create in trfrm has a certain convention/behaior
the normal convention is that if i declare 1resource block , itwil cratea 1 resource bt if i want to reuse d same code to create multiple resources of d same tin then i can pass
in an arguemt thta wil manipulate the behavior ... that is what is a mata argument 

WHILE , 
an ARGUMENT, acts as an input, if u  wnt to input inf into a resource ,u can pass an argument so that it becomes part of the input into your resource
so we put in arguments 

BUT, 
ATTRIBUTES , is what we need to get out of our resource

A MODULE:
we say that you can create a module and a module is just resources (terfrm resources) that you can put inside a dir, now that becomes a module and we can ( call that) can create 
those rsources just by using the module block
so this is one of the trfrm blks among the 10 tfrrm blks that we hv used so far
so u can use a module blk to actually create resources


Tonight we wil continue wit our exploration of teRRAFORM

we'll go over PROVISIONERS AND BACKENDS

PROVISIONERS:
You can use provisioners to model specific actions on the local machine or on a remote machine 
in order to prepare servers or other infrastructure objects for service

illustration:
i have my laptop here , and i want to craete an ec2 instance, in my aws account, i can use trfrm in my laptop to provision the ec2 instance in aws
i can have a resource blk, run trefrm init, terfrm apply , it wil create the ec2 instance
***************** but what if, lets say i have a file in (laptop) my local env and i want it transferred into my ec2 instance once that instance has been created and launchd
and bootstrapped.
this now becosmes a process of configuration, am tryin to config this ec2 instance by transfering a file into it , or i want to run a script once the instance has created

********11:20
one way we saw we can run a script is by using user data, we can use user data to run a script, that is a porcess of configuraton, this is hw i can configure my instance
usingtfrm by using user data
but ehat if i have a script on my
