what is meta data ??

tefrm gives you what are called mata arguments
these are arguments that alter the normal behaviur of our resources 
by default resources that we create in trfrm has a certain convention/behaior
the normal convention is that if i declare 1resource block , itwil cratea 1 resource bt if i want to reuse d same code to create multiple resources of d same tin then i can pass
in an arguemt thta wil manipulate the behavior ... that is what is a mata argument 

WHILE , 
an ARGUMENT, acts as an input, if u  wnt to input inf into a resource ,u can pass an argument so that it becomes part of the input into your resource
so we put in arguments 

BUT, 
ATTRIBUTES , is what we need to get out of our resource
