  AUTOMATING BUILD IN JENKINS (includes jenkins1&2 and jenkins3, INTEGRATING ALL THE SOFTWARES)  while jenkins 4 is types of jenkins project/RUN JOBS (steps
in Using the jenkins options) does nt include 4&5 (B) PLUGINS MANAGEMENT: How to use plugins to achieve automation 


  we integrate Jenkins with:
   Git/Github ,maven, Sonarqube, nexus ,tomcat, nginx webserver  

***** he created one security group and leave all PCES open, so he can use it to create all server 

Jenkins portNumber: 8080  

jenkins was successfully installed with a script bc we did not have to give access to another user 


jenkin 1&2
IQ: Explain you EXPERIENCE in applying Jenkins?? 
Ticket001:
Install Jenkins in redhat9 server (ec2 instance in aws)
   https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/package-management
1) Jenkins installation script  (jenkins-Redhat-install.sh)


After installation, to get password, to unloack jenkins :
  initial password =  /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
 sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

then install suggested pluggins

click new item 
enter new item name 
click freestyle project, then ok 
after which select project name 
then configure 


Tesla Client:
   java web applications    
1. We have created and shared the project GitHub repo  with developers 
      https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/maven-web-application 

Ticket002:
  Create an automation ci/cd job using Jenkins and other associated tools for a FinTech  
  Java based web application.

1. Jenkins Git Integration --         ****jenkins 4&5****************       git pluggins has to be installed in jenkins server for git jenkins integration
      Ensure that Git plugins/Software is installed in the Jenkins server   
      sudo yum install git -y  


***** 1:54:29,   unable to switch user to jenkins 
his username is jenkins bc when he first ran the script , it broke 


2:03:42
first and foremost, we are creating the job  -Github                       ******* (and git pluggins in jenkins website)
2. we need Jenkins Git Integration  ie, installing git in jenkins , we need this integration to be able to clone/pull the code/application from SCM - Github
   jenkins  Github   - jenkins need to integrate with git 
      configure github login credentials in the Jenkins server:  

******** to access jenkins
        userName: legah2045               ******* SCM management: selsct git , add repo link,select add , select jenkins then enter username and the token 
        password: Admin@123  or token
        PERSONAL Access token:  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    (generated in jenkins , classic)

b. Jenkins maven Integration               * to create packages form java based web application 
      Jenkins-Dashboard--manage Jenkins ---Tools and configure --maven  

ie       Jenkins-Dashboard--manage Jenkins ---Tools -- add maven :name version >maven  3.9.4--maven  & dashboard -maven
dashboard 
project -configure-buildstep-add build-targets
version :maven 3.9.4 -invoke top- level maven -goal :clean package, then save and build . 2nd video 17:00



2:09:32  after i build, check ***    , trget has been created and if i check my CLI i see tools 


4)

2:13               2nd video 37:00 to remove sonar integration
c. Jenkins sonarQube Integration   mvn sonar:sonar :           ******To perform code quality analysis  
----------------------------------------------  
NB: Your SonarQube server must be running 
    sudo su - sonar 
      sh /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh status
      sh /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh start 
      curl -v 34.213.64.100:9000 


    1. Edit pom.xml propertiesTAG with SonarQube server URL and login Credentials 
       in the Property TAG  
       http://34.213.64.100:9000/
         username: admin 
         password: admin 

      <Property>          * then go to jenkins server,project configure, select build stseps and add build step, then invoke top level maven, maven version 3.9.4
                                     goal :sonar :sonar,  then save and build now. then login to sonarqube server

**** why cant we create a script and give it all necessary sudo power it needs regarding changing shell so the script can run once 


******* frank used my private ip and changed the version    ( i think this was when he was helping me troubleshoot)

ii. Open required ports in Jenkins server to allow traffic from jenkins server
         port 9000 should be open in the firewall/security group
  or Install and configure JaCoCo plugin in Jenkins UI:

5)
d) Jenkins Nexus Integration;  mvn deploy:
Upload build artifacts:


6)
E) Jenkins tomcat Integration

 TYPES OF JENKINS PROJECTS:
FREE Style project            when u use maven to do a build under free style project, u take more time &nid to do a lot of configurations(we ar always clicking on configure
software builds            so instaed of using freestyle we can use maven projects. to ensure d time used to configure d project is kept to the barest minimum, we use maven project
application deployent
