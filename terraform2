INTERVIW QUESTION   ................. 54:44
terrfrm setting blocks 
 e.g 
if the code is running in produ n terfrm version is version 1.0, then i nid to constrain the ccode to 0.9 so that my code wil stil run .if i run trfrm init it wil download the ryt version 
of trfrm (ver 9), the ryt plugin bc am constraining it  bt if i leave it open , if i dnt pass the version then init will always download the current version n when that happens my code 
may nt be comparible n it wil break n give me error 
so thats how we use terfrm setting block

 when we dnt pass credential we say its goin to use a default prorfile

RESOURCE BLK
we use a resource blk to create anytin we want to create
inorder nt to hardcode the values, we use variables
and when we ar workin with modules, we see that we v given users the flexibility to pass in their own values

OUTPUT VALUES BLK
after our resource hs been create an d we wnt to get a n attribute out of the resource then we use an output blk
we hvc to configure an output, we hv to give it d value 
and the value of our output it uses dot (.) notation
we hv to reference our (resource type.the resource name.the attribute) 
e.g aws_instance.instl.public_ip       .... so this is referencing the resource that we interested in.

LOCAL BLK  ..........1:09 
resource

bc its a long name, i declare it in a lox
