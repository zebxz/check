whenever you are installing a package, you have to make sur eyou an adminstrator or it wont allow you

depending on ther version am running the version dert the syntax, though most of them are backward compartibkle, it wii jst give u warning that this has been depricated,u 
nid to upgrade when it cms to prod u nid to constrin ur version of terfrm so ur code doesnt break
the syntax of code that was written 5years ago will be dif frm code 

INTERVIW QUESTION   ................. 54:44
terrfrm setting blocks 
 e.g 
if the code is running in produ n terfrm version is version 1.0, then i nid to constrain the ccode to 0.9 so that my code wil stil run .if i run trfrm init it wil download
the ryt version of trfrm (ver 9), the ryt plugin bc am constraining it  bt if i leave it open , if i dnt pass the version then init will always download the current version
n when that happens my code may nt be comparible n it wil break n give me error 
so thats how we use terfrm setting block

 when we dnt pass credential we say its goin to use a default prorfile

RESOURCE BLK
we use a resource blk to create anytin we want to create
inorder nt to hardcode the values, we use variables
and when we ar workin with modules, we see that we v given users the flexibility to pass in their own values

OUTPUT VALUES BLK
after our resource hs been create an d we wnt to get a n attribute out of the resource then we use an output blk
we hvc to configure an output, we hv to give it d value 
and the value of our output it uses dot (.) notation
we hv to reference our (resource type.the resource name.the attribute) 
e.g aws_instance.instl.public_ip       .... so this is referencing the resource that we interested in.

LOCAL BLK  ..........1:09 
local.name
we use local blk if we hv long names that we dnt want to repeat writing it in the code , we can define them in my locals blk and then just reference it in my code if this
is smt that is repeatative bc i may hv concatenating variables  e.g the BD  value is the (variable "vpc_name" and variable "my_env ), so i can jst define a locals blk n just
referencd it, so that makes my codes mangeable and easy to read bc hv done all my definitions in my local blk and am just referencing local
so i can put as many values in the local as i want if its a long name i might use inside of my code and then i just reference local
this is hw we use a locals blk


resource "aws_vpc" "my_vpc" {
   cidr _block ="10.0.0.0/16"

   tags = {
      Name = var.vpc_name
      Env = var.my_env
      BD = $(Var.vpc_name)-$(var.my_env)    .... bc this is too long , iil rather reference the locals blk
      BD = local.business       ... so am referencing this as jst a local, it is frm the locals blk but its a key called business n d value of this takes the whole value 
     }                                     of this:  "$(var.vpc_name)"-"$(var.my_env)"  , n this value is read frm these variables (variable "vpc_name and variable "my_env)
   }     BD , ie business division                                                                                  wich wil translate to "my-vpc"_"prod"

variable "vpc_name" {
    type = string
    default = "my-vpc"
}

variable "my_env" {
  type = string
  default = "prod"
}

locals {
business = "$(var.vpc_name)"-"$(var.my_env)"

bucket_business = local.business   ( i did this myself based on the github note)

*********************** bc its a long name, i declare it in a locals blk 




BLK 7: DATA SOURCE     ...... 1:17:35      create a data source for an AMI , we wnt to return a certain AMI 
first create n name the file and open it and startt56
YOU start create a data source oR using a data blk with the keyword data, n data block needs 2 labels 
        data "aws_ami" "amazon_linux" {
          most_recent = true             .... we can check the date the ami was =created and req for the most recent ............1:21:01
         owners = ["amazon"] 


        filter {                  we wnt to filter the AMI bc when we are doing our search, it is goin to return all AMIs that ar owned by amazon n also d most recent
           name= "name"                                                  so we ar goin to apply filters on the specific AMI that we wnt
           values = ["al2023-ami-*-kernel-6.1-x86_64"]          ( we can remove the date n put* so it captures all the AMIs) dnt understand what he means
                                                                       ***its bc we can use this smae data source to get diff AMIs  e.g in a diff region

          filter {
             name = "root-device-type"
             values = ["ebs"] 

when i run terfrm init and terfrm validtawe  and trfrm plna , it will reade the data source n return for me the AMi ID , 
it will run this filters and return an id of an AMI

********************how do i now use THIS ID  ????   ... remeber i hvnt gone to AWS to get this iD , hv jst used this data source
LETS SAY I want to create an ec2 instance 
so i can cereate a resource

  resource "aws_instance" "data_test" {
 ami= data.aws_ami.amazonlinux.id     (.id , bc we nid the id)         ****  instead of me hardcoding the AMI value , i am gon to get vit frm my data vsource
 instance_type = t2.micro                   how do i refernce the data source, attributes frm a data source/resource we alsways use d dot notattion


  *********** now when i run init, validtae and plan , it will run the data source , get the id and replace the id for the AMI 
so i hv dynamicxally gone to aws n got the MAI and substitute it here
bc of this i can use thsi data source to get my AMis dynamically

this AMI belong to US west 2.,, bc thats my default region 
if i pass a provider bc in my code i dnt hv a proider n my provider is AWS and pass a region
*******************  provider = "aws " {
                        region = "us-east-1"

when i run trfrm plan , it wil return an AMI thats ends with 5369 bc of the region , it has used d filter to find the moist recent AMI in thta region bc theyb wil almhv dis filter
similar name bt is just finding that AMi in d specoific region 
so if i change my region , i dnt hv to go on d console to do it, to find that AMi, so now i hv dynamically created it and it has returned for me this AMi and now creating it in 
US east2
*********************if i change my region to US west1, am jst changin my region bt i v my dtatsource
my dtasource will fetch an AMI id that is now 491b , bc this AMI belongs to USwest1
so this is hw we can dynamically use datasourec to provision our resources , we are nt harcoding , instaed we ar usin dataasource to fget info for us ,so i dnt nid to go to
d console  to knw wich region i am in bc we knw AMIs AR REGION SPECIFIC Bt if i use  adatasourec it go to what eber region its bein provision n it lways get the aMi fro , 
AMInthat is specifuc to that ergion and am able to provison my instance

**************** so tahts hw we use  dtata source and data blk
if ur asked to get a data source for a VPC , u wnt to get the VPC id , u can use a data source n build filters n it wil go to any particular region n it wil gett d id based
on the filters u applied 


blk 8: modules blk  ..................1:38:48
modules our code very flexible
  1) ************ HOW DO WE CREATE MODULES .......... ?/?????
so we v the main general dir called terrsfrm master class33 and inside this dir
lets say we hv a dir called test  , this is the dir that has my  tefrm config files 
bc all my code is in inside this testb dir, so i can use this test dir 
that is my module to create an ec2 instance bc all my code is packaged in der bt i can creat a neew file called main.tf
then i can cm to this main (a file in the terrsfrm master class33 dir) and use the key word module
 mdoule " ec2" {     ************ ec2 is the module name
 source = "./test"         the argument that is reQ inside my module is the source, wher is d code/module coming frm ? what is the source of ur module?
                               so i can sya that my source is this presnt dir bt inside of a dir called test

to initialize this module i need to be outside the test dir but inside the overall dir terrsfrm master class33
when i ls in the  terrsfrm master class33 dir, it is goin to see  all the dir and the main.tf file
so ryt here when i run terfm init, it will see only the main.tf file , it isthe only tf file taht it ssees in this dir, bc its nt goin to read insid eof other directries
when i run terfrm init, it first initialies the backend and then the moudeles

********************************INTERVIEW  QUETSIOM ************
WHats the purpose of terfrm init???
firstly, it initializes the backend then 
it initilizies or downloads the modules
thirdly, the provider

******************* so wher is th emodules???
in the  terrsfrm master class33 dir , we see
 it has created a .terfrm dir and in the dir called modules and providers , cos when we ran terfrm init it downloaded modules and providers pluggins
we open the module dir , we see it has a module.json file bt its pointin the source is the test dir , ie it sayin the module soure is in the test dir whic is wher our files
are 
*******now we run terfrm plan , we see itsd initilizing it fr m the module ec2 and its reading that particular datasoure n creating a resource bt its creating it as a module
n its creatin an instance called data test which is part of our module.so this is hw we reuse values/code. 

we can apckage our code , create our code after we v tested  it , put in a dir n that becomes our moduele

2)~~~~~#####################
WE CAN CREATE MODULE FOR VPC
in the overall dir terrsfrm master class33 he created a  dir called vpc  and inside it he ceated a file called main.tf and in the main.tf, he cetaed a resource 

resource "aws_vpc" "vpc" {
     cidr_block = 10.0.0.0/16

now i can go bk to the main.tf file in the test dir and create a module 
   module "vpc" {
       source = "./vpc"
************ so now i v 2modules i am initializing, i v initialized the ec2 module earlierand now i hv a vpc module , so bc now i v dis i need to run terfrm init
so anytime u cahnge a module or add a module , u hv run terafrm init bc the module needs to be downloaded, d module nids to be initialized , 
so bc v added a new module here, this module lives in this vpc dir , inside of this vpc dir i hv my code bt wher am calling d module is on this file (main.tf in test dir)
am just refering wher my code live 

so in my terminal i run terferm init, bt if i just run terfrm plan, it wil say a ERROR, ders a module called vpc is nt installed 
afer runing trfrm init, i run terfrm plqn 
now its goin to create for me 2resources
the first vpc with cidr  10.0.0.0/16
and also the  ec2 instance 
so i hv my code tacked away bt am calling them now as modules              ......1:51


############################### MAKING THE VARIABLE FLEXIBLE ***************************

******************bt still this module  that am passin here is still nt very flexible bc if i give u this code to use n ur calling the module main.tf (test dir) as it is,it means
u are goin to use this cidr  10.0.0.0/16 but if i wnted to mk the cidr flexible, i will use a variable insid eof the module/ vpc file 
     variable " cidr " {
           type = string        ( i am making it and string and nt passing a defULT value, that way, i am making it  REQ 


And then i chnage the info in the vpc resource blk i created earlier   ....      cidr_block = 10.0.0.0/16    to        cidr_block = var.cidr , so that u as the user can now 
                                                                  supply the value
   resource "aws_vpc" "vpc" {
     cidr_block = var.cidr

bt hv nt supplied the value so that u as the user can now supply the value bt frm this module , we knw that it xpects  acidr blk 
 so then now i can cm to my mian.tf (in the test dir) and on this module i provide the value 
          module "vpc" {
       source = "./vpc"
       cidr = 10.0.0.0/16
now i can run terafrm init and trfrm plan , initializes the backend and plan reads the value frm the module vpc 
so am supplying the value of the cidr as the user  in the module and if i edited the vpc module (main.tf in test dir)
so i dnt need to go bk to the vpc file to change the values, am making evrrytin as required/ or as varibales bt when am calling the module , this is when am supplying the
value bt i can equally mk it required so that am passing it as run time  ie comment it , bt if i dnt pass the value 
 
      ##################    USING VARIABLES TO MODULELARIZE MY CODE (when am making my varaiable required)..........................

bt if i dnt pass the value ,1) it is goin to complain that this value is required
so on my module, i need to declare it , i nid to declare a variable called cidr    bt still nt provide it (the value)   ****************1:55
         variable  "cidr" {
             type = string
 
bt  still complaining  ...... 1:55:27 , ie the codes were nt organized
      *************************************** i stil nid to format it 


1:55:   \********************    terfrm format
so when i run terfrm format, it reformats your code , so that ur code is well organized the lines and all
this formtas your code 

now when i run terfrm plan it says missing reQ argument 
   so in the module vpc  ill 
 
module "vpc" {
       source = "./vpc"
       cidr = var.cidr       .......  its reading frm the module btstill i hvnt supplied the value so am still making it required

  variable  "cidr" {
             type = string

so if i run terfrm plan, it now requires me to enter the value bc hv now mk the value required


############## so this is hw we use variableas to modularizeor to make our code as flexible as possible 


QUESTION:
    WHAT CRITERIA DO YOU LOOK AT TO KNOW THE VARIABLE TYPE TO USE 


  ******************* THIS TAKES us to varaibale types




################# TO CREATE VARIABLE 
We create the resource block with the  defaultvalues  (hardcoding)
e.g resource AMi
then we create the variable with type string and the default value 
e.g variable AMi
then go bk to the resource blk, remove the hardcoding we did ( default values) and and reference the variable 
ie :  ami = var.myami


********************   how do u mk a variable  REQuired?
by not giving a default value
when we dnt supply a default value, we make it rEQ variable
e.g , now, in the variable file, if i comment on the instance type, bt in the main file i stil refernce the variable , then the variable becaomes a REQ variabl
