INTERVIW QUESTION   ................. 54:44
terrfrm setting blocks 
 e.g 
if the code is running in produ n terfrm version is version 1.0, then i nid to constrain the ccode to 0.9 so that my code wil stil run .if i run trfrm init it wil download the ryt version 
of trfrm (ver 9), the ryt plugin bc am constraining it  bt if i leave it open , if i dnt pass the version then init will always download the current version n when that happens my code 
may nt be comparible n it wil break n give me error 
so thats how we use terfrm setting block

 when we dnt pass credential we say its goin to use a default prorfile
