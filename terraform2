whenever you are installing a package, you have to make sur eyou an adminstrator or it wont allow you

depending on ther version am running the version dert the syntax, though most of them are backward compartibkle, it wii jst give u warning that this has been depricated,u nid to upgrade
when it cms to prod u nid to constrin ur version of terfrm so ur code doesnt break
the syntax of code that was written 5years ago will be dif frm code 

INTERVIW QUESTION   ................. 54:44
terrfrm setting blocks 
 e.g 
if the code is running in produ n terfrm version is version 1.0, then i nid to constrain the ccode to 0.9 so that my code wil stil run .if i run trfrm init it wil download the ryt version 
of trfrm (ver 9), the ryt plugin bc am constraining it  bt if i leave it open , if i dnt pass the version then init will always download the current version n when that happens my code 
may nt be comparible n it wil break n give me error 
so thats how we use terfrm setting block

 when we dnt pass credential we say its goin to use a default prorfile

RESOURCE BLK
we use a resource blk to create anytin we want to create
inorder nt to hardcode the values, we use variables
and when we ar workin with modules, we see that we v given users the flexibility to pass in their own values

OUTPUT VALUES BLK
after our resource hs been create an d we wnt to get a n attribute out of the resource then we use an output blk
we hvc to configure an output, we hv to give it d value 
and the value of our output it uses dot (.) notation
we hv to reference our (resource type.the resource name.the attribute) 
e.g aws_instance.instl.public_ip       .... so this is referencing the resource that we interested in.

LOCAL BLK  ..........1:09 
local.name
we use local blk if we hv long names that we dnt want to repeat writing it in the code , we can define them in my locals blk and then just reference it in my code if this
is smt that is repeatative bc i may hv concatenating variables  e.g the BD  value is the (variable "vpc_name" and variable "my_env ), so i can jst define a locals blk n just 
referencd it, so that makes my codes mangeable and easy to read bc hv done all my definitions in my local blk and am just referencing local
so i can put as many values in the local as i want if its a long name i might use inside of my code and then i just reference local
this is hw we use a locals blk


resource "aws_vpc" "my_vpc" {
   cidr _block ="10.0.0.0/16"

   tags = {
      Name = var.vpc_name
      Env = var.my_env
      BD = $(Var.vpc_name)-$(var.my_env)    .... bc this is too long , iil rather reference the locals blk
      BD = local.business       ... so am referencing this as jst a local, it is frm the locals blk but its a key called business n d value of this takes the whole value 
     }                                     of this:  "$(var.vpc_name)"-"$(var.my_env)"  , n this value is read frm these variables (variable "vpc_name and variable "my_env)
   }     BD , ie business division                                                                                  wich wil translate to "my-vpc"_"prod"

variable "vpc_name" {
    type = string
    default = "my-vpc"
}

variable "my_env" {
  type = string
  default = "prod"
}

locals {
business = "$(var.vpc_name)"-"$(var.my_env)"

bucket_business = local.business   ( i did this myself based on the github note)

*********************** bc its a long name, i declare it in a locals blk 




BLK 7: DATA SOURCE     ...... 1:17:35      create a data source for an AMI , we wnt to return a certain AMI 
first create n name the file and open it and startt56
YOU start create a data source oR using a data blk with the keyword data, n data block needs 2 labels 
        data "aws_ami" "amazon_linux" {
          most_recent = true             .... we can check the date the ami was =created and req for the most recent ............1:21:01
         owners = ["amazon"] 


        filter {                  we wnt to filter the AMI bc when we are doing our search, it is goin to return all AMIs that ar owned by amazon n also d most recent
           name= "name"                                                  so we ar goin to apply filters on the specific AMI that we wnt
           values = ["al2023-ami-*-kernel-6.1-x86_64"]          ( we can remove the date n put* so it captures all the AMIs) dnt understand what he means
                                                                       ***its bc we can use this smae data source to get diff AMIs  e.g in a diff region

          filter {
             name = "root-device-type"
             values = ["ebs"] 

when i run terfrm init and terfrm validtawe  and trfrm plna , it will reade the data source n return for me the AMi ID , 
it will run this filters and return an id of an AMI

********************how do i now use THIS ID  ????   ... remeber i hvnt gone to AWS to get this iD , hv jst used this data source
LETS SAY I want to create an ec2 instance 
so i can cereate a resource

  resource "aws_instance" "data_test" {
 ami= data.aws_ami.amazonlinux.id     (.id , bc we nid the id)         ****  instead of me hardcoding the AMI value , i am gon to get vit frm my data vsource
 instance_type = t2.micro                   how do i refernce the data source, attributes frm a data source/resource we alsways use d dot notattion


  *********** now when i run init, validtae and plan , it will run the data source , get the id and replace the id for the AMI 
so i hv dynamicxally gone to aws n got the MAI and substitute it here
bc of this i can use thsi data source to get my AMis dynamically

this AMI belong to US west 2.,, bc thats my default region 
if i pass a provider bc in my code i dnt hv a proider n my provider is AWS and pass a region
*******************  provider = "aws " {
                        region = "us-east-1"

when i run trfrm plan , it wil return an AMI thats ends with 5369 bc of the region , it has used d filter to find the moist recent AMI in thta region bc theyb wil almhv dis filter
similar name bt is just finding that AMi in d specoific region 
so if i change my region , i dnt hv to go on d console to do it, to find that AMi, so now i hv dynamically created it and it has returned for me this AMi and now creating it in 
US east2
*********************if i change my region to US west1, am jst changin my region bt i v my dtatsource
my dtasource will fetch an AMI id that is now 491b , bc this AMI belongs to USwest1
so this is hw we can dynamically use datasourec to provision our resources , we are nt harcoding , instaed we ar usin dataasource to fget info for us ,so i dnt nid to go to d console  to
knw wich region i am in bc we knw AMIs AR REGION SPECIFIC Bt if i use  adatasourec it go to what eber region its bein provision n it lways get the aMi fro , AMInthat is specifuc to 
that ergion and am able to provison my instance

**************** so tahts hw we use  dtata source and data blk
if ur asked to get a data source for a VPC , u wnt to get the VPC id , u can use a data source n build filters n it wil go to any particular region n it wil gett d id based on the 
filters u applied 


blk 8: modules blk  ..................1:38:48
modules our code very flexible
   ************ HOW DO WE CREATE MODULES .......... ?/?????

lets say we hv this dir called test  , this is the dir that has my  tefrm config files 
bc all my code is in inside this testb dir, so i can use this test dir 
that is my module to create an ec2 instance bc all my code is packaged in der bt i can creat a neew file called main.tf
then i can cm to this main (a file in the test dir) and use the key word module
 mdoule " ec2" {     ************ ec2 is the module name
 source = "./test"         the argument that is reQ inside my module is the source, wher is d code/module coming frm ? what is the source of ur module?
                               so i can sya that my source is this presnt dir bt inside of a dir called test

to initialize this module i need to be outside the test dir but inside the overall dir terrsfrm master class33
when i ls in the  terrsfrm master class33 dir, it is goin to see  all the dir and the main.tf file
so ryt here when i run terfm init, it will see only the main.tf file , it isthe only tf file taht it ssees in this dir, bc its nt goin to read insid eof other directries
when i run terfrm init, it first initialies the backend and then the moudeles
