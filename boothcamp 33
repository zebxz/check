explain ur experience with jenkins, problems uve faced and work me tru your jenkins pipeline

ANS:  by student
Thank you for having me, my name is Cecilia Ekeh, i have over 5years experience as a devops engr and hv built a robust CI/CD and i stage my CI/CD frm 5stages thats from code ,
build, test, deploy, and monitoring . and my CI/CD pipeline i use declarative CI/CD pipeline in coporation with automation tools LIKE jenkins, maven, sonarqube, doker , ansible
kubeneterns, promethus and grafana and in that project i build a java web appl such that i create a github for the projectand in the project i mk sure that my developers submit
their code through the pull REQ such that if thers need for us to review the code we can easily review the code b4 we approve it and my github env i hv branching strategy such
that i have future branch, hot fix fix branch and prod branch such that if thers any issue wit the code we can create a future branch and after the issue is resolved , mayb
the client REQ we modify one of the features so that we can use the fix hot branch to fix it.
also in my git env, i conifgure my github web hook such that at anytime point in time thers a commit of code frm my developer to the github env, my webhook will push the code
to jenkins which will trigger a build which is still part of my continius intergration and also i use maven to build the code, compile, validate and run unit test cases on each
of the lines of the code and after the successful build i intergrate my maven wit jenkins which is part of my continous integration and bc we are very kin of the code we deploy
to prod so we use sonarqube for test the code quality against bug, vulneriblity, code smell after testing run tru the quality gate , then everybody can see it on the dashboard
also i use ansible for configuration, patching and upgrading of my webapp, after which i still integrate with my jenkins which is still part of my continous integration and 
after that i use docker for packiaging and containerizing of our appl aferwhich i use dockerfile to build the image and push the image to dockerhub and thats part of our 
continous deployment then i use k8 for container ochestration, and hv structured my k8 env such that i deploy to my name sapce bc if i dnt create a namespace the appl goes to 
default but i dnt wnat that bc i wnt to mk sure that k8 cl8 is well structured and well secured , i also create my metrix server to aggregrate resource utilization in the cl8
env and in my cl8 also i configure my loadbalancer and my database and i also inteegrate it with my jenkins which is the prod, ie continous delivery and for monitoring, i use
promethus and grafana to monitor how the appl is perfroming to ensure evryin is moving smoothly and deploying the appl according and thats hw i manage my CI/CD pipeline

*************
proff, i like your intro i have 5years experience using jenkins in my env, , these are typical questions you shud expect as far as jenkins is concerned and any other tool we 
hv done so far
