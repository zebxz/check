explain ur experience with jenkins, problems uve faced and work me tru your jenkins pipeline

ANS:  by student
Thank you for having me, my name is Cecilia Ekeh, i have over 5years experience as a devops engr and hv built a robust CI/CD and i stage my CI/CD frm 5stages thats from code ,
build, test, deploy, and monitoring . and my CI/CD pipeline i use declarative CI/CD pipeline in coporation with automation tools LIKE jenkins, maven, sonarqube, doker , ansible
kubeneterns, promethus and grafana and in that project i build a java web appl such that i create a github for the projectand in the project i mk sure that my developers submit
their code through the pull REQ such that if thers need for us to review the code we can easily review the code b4 we approve it and my github env i hv branching strategy such
that i have future branch, hot fix fix branch and prod branch such that if thers any issue wit the code we can create a future branch and after the issue is resolved , mayb
the client REQ we modify one of the features so that we can use the fix hot branch to fix it.
also in my git env, i conifgure my github web hook such that at anytime point in time thers a commit of code frm my developer to the github env, my webhook will push the code
to jenkins which will trigger a build which is still part of my continius intergration and also i use maven to build the code, compile, validate and run unit test cases on each
of the lines of the code and after the successful build i intergrate my maven wit jenkins which is part of my continous integration and bc we are very kin of the code we deploy
to prod so we use sonarqube for test the code quality against bug, vulneriblity, code smell after testing run tru the quality gate , then everybody can see it on the dashboard
also i use ansible for configuration, patching and upgrading of my webapp, after which i still integrate with my jenkins which is still part of my continous integration and 
after that i use docker for packiaging and containerizing of our appl aferwhich i use dockerfile to build the image and push the image to dockerhub and thats part of our 
continous deployment then i use k8 for container ochestration, and hv structured my k8 env such that i deploy to my name sapce bc if i dnt create a namespace the appl goes to 
default but i dnt wnat that bc i wnt to mk sure that k8 cl8 is well structured and well secured , i also create my metrix server to aggregrate resource utilization in the cl8
env and in my cl8 also i configure my loadbalancer and my database and i also inteegrate it with my jenkins which is the prod, ie continous delivery and for monitoring, i use
promethus and grafana to monitor how the appl is perfroming to ensure evryin is moving smoothly and deploying the appl according and thats hw i manage my CI/CD pipeline

*************
proff, i like your intro i have 5years experience using jenkins in my env, , these are typical questions you shud expect as far as jenkins is concerned and any other tool we 
hv done so far

DEVOPS is not a tool, its a methodology the aim is to be able to achieve automation and continous improvement when it comes to software delivery and appl development, thats 
what devops is all about and bc its nt a tool, it uses  a set of tools , git for example for versioningbc when developers are developing appl that will be developed, ther
will be multiple version of that appl that will be created for the clients and how is that vsersions managed, so git is the open source software/tool that is able to track 
changes in the code so we use git for versioning, as a matter of fact we classify git as a ditributed vesrion control system, so devops is making use of multiple tools and 
git is one of them and not just git it also deals with source code mgt tool,ther are multiple tools , github, gitlab etc, so when it comes to managing the source code github is
involved
i must say here that in my env we are managing java based project, ofcourse project can be multiple languages be it python project, java script, be it  mpm, there are multiple
types of projects that could be managed 
from time to time, we manage other related projects but our main focus has been on java project and to that effect we are building this project after the devlopers hv wriiten 
the code, we are buiding it using a java based tool called maven , with the help of maven in our development process we can then do a build and all of this is part of the 
devops process bc to ease of all of these proceses we are nt just using maven directly bt we are using another devops tool that helps to automate the connection , it helps to 
connect/integrate the dot together and the tool is claled jenkins so with the help of jenkins once developers commit a new version of the appl in github, jenkins will pull the
new version of the appl and jenkins is connecting with mave to do a build,
and again, maven is a very powerful build tool and its open source, its an open source tool that will help us ensure that the code is well written, it validates the code, it 
checks the file structure, it ensures everyting was well done as expected and once its validated, it goes ahead to compile the java classes, after which it does unit test cases
and if the unit test cases passes in maven then the packages are created , so with a simple mpm package al of this is goin to be realised

AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT MAVEN CAN DO ALL  OF THIS ?

its possible bc maven makes use of pluggins, dependencies and with the help of this maven is able to validate the code, compile java classes, run unit test cases and able to 
create packages, so you see that when it comes to devops processes, deveops is all about improvement, so when it brings in maven, maven ensures that packages
