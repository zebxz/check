explain ur experience with jenkins, problems uve faced and work me tru your jenkins pipeline

ANS:  by student
Thank you for having me, my name is Cecilia Ekeh, i have over 5years experience as a devops engr and hv built a robust CI/CD and i stage my CI/CD frm 5stages thats from code ,
build, test, deploy, and monitoring . and my CI/CD pipeline i use declarative CI/CD pipeline in coporation with automation tools LIKE jenkins, maven, sonarqube, doker , ansible
kubeneterns, promethus and grafana and in that project i build a java web appl such that i create a github for the projectand in the project i mk sure that my developers submit
their code through the pull REQ such that if thers need for us to review the code we can easily review the code b4 we approve it and my github env i hv branching strategy such
that i have future branch, hot fix fix branch and prod branch such that if thers any issue wit the code we can create a future branch and after the issue is resolved , mayb
the client REQ we modify one of the features so that we can use the fix hot branch to fix it.
also in my git env, i conifgure my github web hook such that at anytime point in time thers a commit of code frm my developer to the github env, my webhook will push the code
to jenkins which will trigger a build which is still part of my continius intergration and also i use maven to build the code, compile, validate and run unit test cases on each
of the lines of the code and after the successful build i intergrate my maven wit jenkins which is part of my continous integration and bc we are very kin of the code we deploy
to prod so we use sonarqube for test the code quality against bug, vulneriblity, code smell after testing run tru the quality gate , then everybody can see it on the dashboard
also i use ansible for configuration, patching and upgrading of my webapp, after which i still integrate with my jenkins which is still part of my continous integration and 
after that i use docker for packiaging and containerizing of our appl aferwhich i use dockerfile to build the image and push the image to dockerhub and thats part of our 
continous deployment then i use k8 for container ochestration, and hv structured my k8 env such that i deploy to my name sapce bc if i dnt create a namespace the appl goes to 
default but i dnt wnat that bc i wnt to mk sure that k8 cl8 is well structured and well secured , i also create my metrix server to aggregrate resource utilization in the cl8
env and in my cl8 also i configure my loadbalancer and my database and i also inteegrate it with my jenkins which is the prod, ie continous delivery and for monitoring, i use
promethus and grafana to monitor how the appl is perfroming to ensure evryin is moving smoothly and deploying the appl according and thats hw i manage my CI/CD pipeline

*************
proff, i like your intro i have 5years experience using jenkins in my env, , these are typical questions you shud expect as far as jenkins is concerned and any other tool we 
hv done so far

TO YOU WHAT IS DEVOPS ?? 
***************

DEVOPS is not a tool, its a methodology the aim is to be able to achieve automation and continous improvement when it comes to software delivery and appl development, thats 
what devops is all about and bc its nt a tool, it uses  a set of tools , git for example for versioningbc when developers are developing appl that will be developed, ther
will be multiple version of that appl that will be created for the clients and how is that vsersions managed, so git is the open source software/tool that is able to track 
changes in the code so we use git for versioning, as a matter of fact we classify git as a ditributed vesrion control system, so devops is making use of multiple tools and 
git is one of them and not just git it also deals with source code mgt tool,ther are multiple tools , github, gitlab etc, so when it comes to managing the source code github is
involved
i must say here that in my env we are managing java based project, ofcourse project can be multiple languages be it python project, java script, be it  mpm, there are multiple
types of projects that could be managed 
from time to time, we manage other related projects but our main focus has been on java project and to that effect we are building this project after the devlopers hv wriiten 
the code, we are buiding it using a java based tool called maven , with the help of maven in our development process we can then do a build and all of this is part of the 
devops process bc to ease of all of these proceses we are nt just using maven directly bt we are using another devops tool that helps to automate the connection , it helps to 
connect/integrate the dot together and the tool is claled jenkins so with the help of jenkins once developers commit a new version of the appl in github, jenkins will pull the
new version of the appl and jenkins is connecting with mave to do a build,
and again, maven is a very powerful build tool and its open source, its an open source tool that will help us ensure that the code is well written, it validates the code, it 
checks the file structure, it ensures everyting was well done as expected and once its validated, it goes ahead to compile the java classes, after which it does unit test cases
and if the unit test cases passes in maven then the packages are created , so with a simple mpm package al of this is goin to be realised

AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT MAVEN CAN DO ALL  OF THIS ?

its possible bc maven makes use of pluggins, dependencies and with the help of this maven is able to validate the code, compile java classes, run unit test cases and able to 
create packages, so you see that when it comes to devops processes, deveops is all about improvement, so once it brings in maven, maven ensures that packages but it doent 
just end there, bc a good pipeline considers several factors including security, diaster recovery etc , so once maven informs us that these are packages created within our 
devops cycle, we hv a tool thats incharge of the code quality.called quality checker, which is sonarqube, sonarqube has been part of our project, it is part of our project, it
performs code quality analysis and establishes report that informs of the quality, ie, good,medium or poor quality but before that in our env we hv created our benchmark for
code quality called quality gates/profiles, our benchmark hv been created eg, for most our project our becnchmark is expected to be atleast 90%, which implies that developers
are expected to write atleast 9 out of 10 lines for test cases , so sonarqube wil be checking if this is what the developers actually did, so deveops with all of this, jenkins
is helping to connect all of this tool together to integrtae them together so with the help of jenkins we can achieve continous integration where once developers commit a code
and evrything is fine then artifacts are created
so this is what devops is all about, it stretches beyound that point bc once we hv sonarqube performing that task the nxt tin is that we hv our artifacts once sonarqube validates
and tell us that these are good code, the nxt tin is we nid to backup the artifact just inacse thers a disater and we use artifactries to be able to be upload our artifacts into
and in our env we use an open source artifactory called nexus and of course ther are other artifactries you could ude like jfork, amazon, ecr bt in our env we principally use
nexus for that purpose so once the artifcats are uploaded we are now reday for deployment and to deploy we get into a predeployment phase where we hv a  docker file which we 
use to containerise our appl bc we are basically managing containerized appl with the help of a docker file we are able to create images, share the imgaes in docker registry for
eg in our env we using dockerhub ....... 

************ so u must always speak as someone who is at work not one in the class u see when am speaking i want to tk u bk to my env, 

 and once the images are in dockerhub we no whv our container ochestra, we hv a tool we are using to ochetrate these containers which is called k8, so with the help of k8
our containers are created, scaled, managed, if thers a problem it comes to a self healing capability,  eg if theres a problem k8 will ensure that eg if a port went down 
since we always use controller mangers in our deployment, they will recretae the port , if a node goes down, all the pods running on that node will be evicted and automatically 
assigned to new node.. thats how we achieve our build release and deployment job , just bc we mk use of devops and devops helps use to be able to integrate with diff tools to
be able to achieve our objectives but we dnt only deploy the appl and end ther
we ask our selves whta happens if the appl goes down how are we goint o be made aware, how are we goin to be made informed, so still within our devops processes using automation
tool like jenkins we hv what is called continous monitoring , we hv to observe hw the appl is performing so contantly we are observing, is the appl perfroming well or not
how are we goin to know , so since we manage containerized appl in our env, we hv what is called promthus and grafana , and with this we deploy an apll monitoring tool kit 
that monitors all the appl and if thers a prob we will be allerted bc promethus comes with couple of micro services and one of them is the alert manger. we hv creatd alert manger 
eg if a pod is down an alert is down a alert will be triggered, if a node is down an alert is triggered, if a node is low on cpu or memory, an alert will be trigerred , we hv
configured all of this . when it comes to monitoring tha apll but this is not all , we want to also knw hw our appl are behaving, so we hv a log mgt appl in our ev equally 
called elastic search hybrid and kibana, it tells us how our appl are behaving , this is also deployed in our env, in all of this we also ensure that everything is done securely 
so continous securtiy is of eptical importance in our env

********** so if you ask me the question of what devops is all about it can take you to any level that you want to go, you can go any dirextion bt whatever direction u want to 
use the bottom line is that u just hv to ensure that your communication is intelligent as per what devops is all about

*********** 
what do you use for versiong??
you use git not github as 
we use github as a source code manager, the software used for versoning is git
github is a source code manger used for source code manger


WHAT ARE THE BSET GIT PROCESSES IN our env   ???

ANS:
 dnt tell us that w hv to make sure that, u are speaking abt what you do at work not what u were taught in sch
bc you are graduating as someone wth 5years working exp , not as soemone who has just done devops programm

you say in my env, i ensure this is happening , this is nt happening 


50:00
TELL US WHAT YOU USE GIT FOR 
ANS:
We use git for versoning and github as our source code manager
my experience includes git installation, i hv installed git on both linux and windows systems and if theres a problem hv been able to upgrade the version frm lower to higher 
version 
i hv able to mk use of git as a versioning tool, also made use of github as a source code mgT TOOL.
when it comes to my job we hv what is called git best practices in our project
the first get to do we us making us of the CLI over making use of the console so if w ehv a job to mange ther are 2options, either we go and modify the code directly frm the
repository which is nt recommended or u validate the code using an IDE, so 9 out of 10 we use and we recommend our developers to be making use of IDEs bc it simplifies their
job significantly 
also part of our best practices include branching strategy, here we maintain a minimum of3 develpoment line or 3 branch bc a branch is a line of development, and the 3
branches include the development,stage and master ,those are the 3 minimum branches that we maintain and it is worth noting that our env is configured such that if thers any
commit in the dev bracndh, it will trigger a job and the job will be built and deployed in the dev env, if thers any commit the stage, a job is triggered and it be deployed
in the testing or UAT env
if thers a commit in the master branch it wil be deploying that version in production,( which means that to acknowledge client) it is worth mentioning here that as part of
our branching strategy w ednt allow direct commit in the master branch, so we hv what is called branch protection and this is enforced such that you are not allowed to 
commit any code directly in the master branch
