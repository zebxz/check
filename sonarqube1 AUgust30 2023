SONARQUBE 

********** java is a prerequisite for sonar
if java is not installed sonarqube cant run 


the theory 37:30, 

developers write testcases & unit 

log in with default username and password

1:25
1:13:18    copy package mgt link in running note 

1:32:30  After sonar installed, installed  sudo yum install tree








   sonarqube  home dir/opt/sonar


33:00    Sonarqube  has to do with software quality 

code quality with sonarqube & sonar cloud 

software testing :before application is deployed we have to do software testing 



        TYPES OF TESTING 
UNit testing [Junit ) : Used to test individual ,  line , units or components of a code 

functional testing: we test how the code ( Application is functioning)

42:30 

REgression testing : frm v1, v2, v3,  
if we add 500 lines to v3, we use 
Regression testing to check if the entire application is working  well based on the addition to the app

eg
helloworld .java = 500 lines of code
helloword test.java = 500 Junit cases cases  expected 


performance testing : is it performing as desire 
penertration:    To test if anyone can break into  the system  using any username & password


code quality  tools
sonarqube, sonarcloud , resheper, codacy, checkmarks



we have our java projects we are managing in git/github
src codes : app.java
JunitTests cases: appTEst.java         10,000 lines of code
build scripts - pom.xml:                 4,000 unit test cases


   maven   = mvn package 
1) validate 
2) compiles   [app.java >>> app.class]
3) testing (run unit testing) pass
4) pacakges will be created

  therfore: there is a quality gate in maven 
however, it runs unit testing on the number of testcase developers
have written but most of the time developers will not write the code as desired thats why we need code quality tool to check, but maven doesnt check if developers have written 
the desired number of testcases

  Using code quality tool quality tool in
