QUESTION, Why is it not able to ping , thought thats one of the adv of custom ntwrk, if a container is recreated it can stil be in the same ntwrk bc it can connect with either 
IP addresss or container name and in this case, the cointainer was recreated with the same name. app

Docker networks & Micro-services:
===================================
What is a network ?
Group of servers/devices connected to each other in a specific network. If Servers
are in same network each one can talk to another server.

#########if i hv devices i can create a ntwrk ,wit the help of a router we can ntwrk ..  a grp of devices communicating with each other
with the help of the router it wil det hw the traffic is routed
u ensure that resources in ur ntwrk can communicate wit each oda.. they can communicate wit each oda bc thers a router and this bc becomes ur ntwrk
### so when we talk abt a ntwrk its ensuring the devices are able to communicate with each other 

Docker network
============= 
If One Container has to talk to another Container 
Using ContainerIP/Name(DNS) in Docker.
Both has to be created under same docker network.

If Containers are in two different networks. 
They can't communicate/access each other.
 
How to list networks in docker?

                                                TYPES OF NETWORKS
difff ntwrks to tk note of 
3kinds of ntwrks were listed
ubuntu@docker:~$ docker network ls

0f1d053a3f91   none      null      local

1) Default bridge network 
2) host network 
3) none network



DIFF BTW THE TYPES OF NETWORKS       ****i complied the diff from the note*************************

 ********docker 3&4 .... 1:25:00 to deploy a 2nd conatiner using the d same image, 
2 containers cannot v the same host port number& name  , bt can v the same conatainer number
host port must change ie we hv to choose a port nmuber for each contaoiner but container port is nt changing
**** docker7; networks:  
We can't create more than one container with d same container port in host network, except in the default bridge netwrk, bt we hv to do port publishing



1)DEFAULT BRIDE NETWRK
containers communicate with only the containerID
e.g  if a container was dead and it comes bk to life  e.g smt goes wrong n its recreated, it comes bk to life with a new IP address and as such communication
will be broken bc containers communicate with the ip adress in the default bridge ntwrk so for that reason, we use what is called custom bridge ntwrk. 
****mee*** in the default bridge netwrk, We can create more than one container with d same container port , bt we hv to do port publishing


2)CUSTOM BRIDGE NETWRK
 docker network create tesla        ***to create the tesla netwrk
containers communicate with IPS and the container name, so even if a container is recreated, it will be recreated with the same container name so it can stil communicate wit
each other.


3)HOST NETWRK  
We can't create more than one container with d same container port in host network, except in the default bridge netwrk, bt we hv to do port publishing
         2.21.20   docker logs apps .. we see binding exception

Docker Host Network.:
If we create containers in host network. 
Container will not have IP Address. and we cant do port forwarding -p
 Container will be created in a system network.

docker run --name javaapp -d --network host mylandmarktech/java-web-app   
   ContainerPort: 8080                                                        ************ IT HAS ITS CONTAINER PORT 8080  
*********i can deploy the application & access this first application/container but if i create another container with the same container port 8080, it will
nt run the first container 'javaapp' 8080 is in use & bc this is host netwrk, WHATEVA PORT the container is having dats what wil be assigned to the host 
We can't create more than one container with d same container port in host network, except in the default bridge netwrk, bt we hv to do port publishing
.



4)NONE/NULL NETWRK
If we create container in none/null network. Container will not have IP Address.
We can't access  containers in this network  Internal or external 
****************** we can use this ntwrk to isolate containers

docker run --name hello -d --network none mylandmarktech/hello   
cant be accessed Internal or external 

*************************************************************************


1) Default bridge network 
in the default bridge netwrk, if i hv 2 containers in this ntwrk, hw do they communicate with each other
e.g if am managing a micro service application, these app can either be deployed under .. incomplete  **i bliv he wanted to say, custom bridge ntwrk or host ntwrk
e.g we hv an ebay webapplication


                                  APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE
1)  MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE: ebay webapp
   if u wnt to acces thhis appl, it has cm with diff component : so when u acces this appl, u can login/registration/cart/pay/order/ and if ders a problem you can return  
this type of appl wher everytin is coupled together we call it monolithic architecture, so it is developed using monolithic architecture 


2) MICRO SERVICES
12:52 bt now we can decide to use microservices , with microservices, this ebay application is decoupled
microservices architecture: for it to be a microservices , we hv each of theses appl  components decoupled
 ebay.war  = decoupled  , they are now stanalone entities
   login.jar
   registration.jar
   cart.jar
   pay.jar
   order.jar
   return.jar  
************** so we hv decouples these appl from a monolithic to a micorservice appli
and we will see why such a decision can be arrived at using nttwrk


HE XPLAINED USING A DIAGRAM
my docker host server, on it we v containers e. a webaapp deployed, i hv a data base container thas suppose to wrk wit the web app 
before we start to build the application, it has gone tru the devlopment stage wher debelopers ar writing code n comiting it to a scm , so we hv an scm tool github and inside g
github we hv a repo called ebay, now once this appli is developed , it goes tru a build phase n in the build server we ar doing the docker buld n mvn package frm this build
server we ar creating packages and doing docker push.. so we hv our docker image , a docker image is being created n frm the docker image what ar we able to ? 
now we hv our deployment server wher we execute docker run to create the contianer n start it 
when we execute mvn package, we create ebay.war n when we execute docker build we create ebay image e.g verion1  ,, ebay:1 , we push the image n it goes to the registry e.g
docker hub , so if we ar going to do a deployment, this image shud be pulled from docker hub

20:40 bt now, this ebay appl we decide to decouple it into microservices and when that happens 
we hv a situtaion wer dev ar writn code n committing to github &when it comes to github it wil no longer be ebay(repo), this appl is being broken doewn into login, so we hv 
a repo for login, a repo registrtaion, a repo to cretae a cart, a repo for returns , these ar the diff repo we hv created when it comes to this projeect, so when we pull this
image we ar creating multiple packages e.g login.jar up to retruns.jar, these ar packages, artifcats hv been created n frm here we building images, diff versions like 
login:1, reg:1 , returns:1  .. we can push this image to the registry and frm der we ar able to deploy the application , we ar albe to deploy appl in the deployment server.

#### 25:19 my docker host server, on it we v containers e. a webaapp deployed, i hv a data base container thas suppose to wrk wit the web app 
so the idea is if u v 2 containers like this, hw do we ensure they  commnunicate wit each oda. so hw can they first commu icta wit ecah oda
for them to bale able to comnunicate in docker, the netwrk concept is important. 
so we hv docker ntwrk concept
first the 2ntwrks must be in the same ntwrk 


NETWORKS contd.
we hv default bridge ntwrk 
in this ntwrk containers wil commuincate with each other using containerIPS , SO WITH THE HELP OF CONTAinerips  theY can communicate with ecah oda

PROBLEMS WITH DEFAULT BRIDGE NTWRK
e.g a if containers was dead and it comes bk to life  e.g smt goes wrong n its recreated, it come sbk to life with a new IP address and as such communication will be broken
so for that reason, we use what is called custom bridge ntwrk. 

**************28:30     CUSTOM BRIDGE NTWRK
containers communicate with IPS and the container name, so even if a container is recreated, it will be recreated with the same container name so it can stil communicate wit
each other.
*****in the custom bridge ntwrk we can create a ntwrk called e.g EBAY NETWRK


 ARCHITECTURE contd...
AGAIN, we ar talking abt a situation were der are multiple micro services
e.g in the above case were a couple of images hv been created 
so the imaegs hv been pushed to the image registry e.g docker hub
we wnt to do a deployment , now this is our deployment server, this containers need to communicate with each oda, we wnt to deploy our containers in these deployment server
e.g the login container, wich nid to communicate with registaration container ,cart container needs to communicate with pay container, we also v a db container etc and all
of this is captured in the dabase container ,, therefore a custom bridge ntwrk is the best to create for the containers to communicate with each other.using d container name
so we deploy the containers in a custom bridge ntwrk 
BUT this entirely is called microservices, its called microservice deployent. 
we wn tto deploy our app uisng micro services , so we hv decoupled frm monlitic to microservices


34:09                      WHY IS IT IMP TO DECOUPLE
A Micor service architecture is easy to manage, 
its also easy to scale

e.g if ur dealing wit a monolitic appl and ur code is in github 
if ur using just ebay, ebay could hv 
monolithic = ebay / 20,000 lines of code 

then for micro services wich ebay has been decoupled
microservices architecture:
   login 2,000 lines of code 
   registration 4,000 lines of code 
   cart 2,000 lines of code 
   pay 6,000 lines of code 
   order 2,000 lines of code 
   return 8,000 lines of code   
*********************************************** therfore micro services is easier to manage:

38:47 just a free talk *****************using the traditional approach, deploying with tomcat
we hv tomcat app sevr1 , tomcat app server 2, for ebay and we v users trying to access our applictaion 
at the moment we v s0m users trying to user bt when they increase frm 20M to 30m, that means we ar scaling , so we hv another anoda app server ie tomcat app server3
ussers are accessing the appl with a webserver, its probably nginx or an elastic loadbalancer ,, therefore traffic is being routed
now this is a monlithic architecture bc inside github, we hv a single repository wich is for ebay only
when its nt decoupled its nt easy to scale compared to microservices wher we v the dif components,a repo for login, a repo registrtaion, a repo to cretae a cart, a repo for
returns , 
easy to  scale  :
    login=20m - 28m /  e.g in a case wher the login increases frm 20m to 28m then i nid to scale login only, i dnt v to scale/modify the entire appl
    reg=20 /
    cart=8m /
    pay=7m/
    order=7m /
    returns=1m ] 

better/efficient resource usage : 
********e.g in a case wher the login increases frm 20m to 28m then i nid to scale login only, i dnt v to scale/modify the entire appl
    so micro services leads to better use of resource bc when u scale jst a component, it means the overall resources to be used wil be smaller 

****************versioning is easier to manage with microservices (bc we hv to modify some codes)
also if thers a new version of the appl that relates with only the login e.g we ar changing the login interface, then we dnt nid to modify the the entire 20,000 line of 
codes as with monolithic but only the 2,000lines of code for login for microservices




                           DEPLOY A MICRO SERVICE USING SPRING BOOT FRAMEWORK
46:20 ************************************************** We support Java based applications:
===================================
We support nodeJS and .net based applications: (also some python base appl, like we saw when we were doing container, we deployed a python base application)
==============================================

**** the challenge in this ticket is to see how to deploy the database container as stateful ie needs to maintain its state, therefore it needs 
a piece of storage to capture data, therefore we can create a mountpoint and mount ie docker volume concept

#####meeee**QUESTION, HW DO WE KNOW WHICH ENV VARIABLE VALUE TO USE ,, BC here both the applictaion(spring) has its env var & the database has its own env ???????
i bliv the the devolopers indicate the 'env var' in the code/document they commit in the repo

        ****i bliv this is like a key (the variable) & padlock (env variable)situation...
******he said this in the nxt video , the application passes the variable,ie its like having to be authorized to access the db, thefore the 
input used for the application shud b d same used for the db
e.g  the password we assigned/decide to use should be the same for both the appl & the db but the hostname comes from the db  (mongodb)
     *** i got to realise that what i used to think is the application name is called the hostname, or mayb its called 'applictaion host name.
*** eg, (hostname 'mongodb') ..docker run --name mongodb --network tesla -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=devdb -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=devdb@123 mongo

                                                    CREATE VOL USING BIND MOUNT
1:34:10
*****************************   WE ARE GOING TO SEE HOW TO DEPLOY THE DATA BASE TO AVOID DATA LOSS/HOW TO CHANGE MOUNT POINT
haven passed the ENV variables correctly,and deployed the application bt thers a data loss problem
now we hv 2 containers that hv been deployed, the mongo container for database and the springapp container which is a STATELESS APP, bt d database is STATEFUL n needs to 
maintain its state and when it is STATEFUL, it means that it needs a piece of storage to capture data, so w ecan create a mountpoint and mount it wit the
dockerhost server, he is the guy hosting all our containers.

                                STEPS TO CREATE THE vol/ CHECK GITHUB FOR 'mongodb' MOUNT POINT
1) i call the storage temp/db, ie I bliv the storage is called 'temp' while 'db' is the mount point from the official document.
bt wot is the container mount point,i must check the hw the container mount point is in the image, so i go to the official document for mongo
it will give me the mount point(where data is stored ) and it says /data/db,  (***DOCKER 9&10, MSQL MOUNT POINT IS VAR/LIB/MSQL)
                                 
                             i bliv this is optional;  HOW TO CHANGE MOUNT POINT 
1:37:00 so on the image i cannot change it bt i can change it in the host server (dockerhost)if i want to e.g, 
i can change it to /tmp/mydb,so mydb is the customised name for my mount point,  this type of data storage is called 'BIND MOUNT'
(its under volume concept in docker) which we will look at.
having done this, in deploying my mongo contianer , we'l use the -V  ,     -V /tmp/mydata: paired to /data/db mongo


2)  This is the command from step5 above; DEPLOYING THE DATABASE with the vol                                                              
     5) docker run --name mongodb --network tesla -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=devdb -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=devdb@123 -V /tmp/mydata: paired to 
                  /data/db mongo
   therefore                               
this is the mount point for my container: /data/db   and       i bliv  'data' is the name of the storage while 'db' is the name of the official mount point
this is the mount point for my docker host server: /tmp/mydata     ie  temp is the name of the storage while my data is the name of the customized mountpoint


*****from docker8&9***** 
we did another eg with bind mount
we created anoda vol called mongo & i realised that /tmp/ is the name of the vol, /mongo, is the customized mount point, while /tmp/mongo, the dir we created
In the host server, data is stored in  /data/db, and this is the dir that was created /tmp/mongo:
ubuntu@docker:¬ $  ls /tmp/mongo/

QUESTION
in trying to acces the application, when u input ur information in the app, u can see it in the database,, ...hw does this relate to API???????????? bc API is suppose to be 
used for communications btw programmes ,, so is it the same thing or they ar diff
ANS:
its the same thing, All  those applications have endpoints, so they are restful API that u nid to acces the application on... so its basically the same stuff in this example
which implies that if u were deploying an application that u nid to access it, the ar 2things here: u hv an application thet is classified as a STATELESS application, it
permits cx to acess/query some data ovea the internet, dat can expose dem to access their bank account etc bt when they access their bank account, they nid to enter stuff like 
their email address, phone number,DOB etc when this information is entered, it nids to be captured in the database so der nid to b a comm btw the dtabase n the application 
server,,,................that the first part of it
*********** the 2nd part is that: for the endusrs to even access the application there ar some APIs to query, so if u type landmark.spring app. com. u wnt to query taht API
and that API nid to be available before u can access it .... thats why U NID TO ENSURE THAT these applications are MONITORED. FOR HIGH AVAILABILITY


**************************************************************************************************************************************************************


cONT... Now we run step4 again with the volume command
********ORIginally der was no volume indicated, now we ar passing volume so we remove the mongo container .... dockeer rm -f mongodb 
############ now we redeploy it again ( he used the springapp.sh script dis time n it worked , bt commented oon the pull REQ and docker run for spring)
docker run --name mongodb --network tesla -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=devdb -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=devdb@123 -v /tmp/mydata:/data/db mongo (MONGO IS the image name)
************************* having redeployed it sucessfully, we enter some data and remove the mongo container again dockeer rm -f mongodb 
then we redeploy the container again and when we check, we can still see the previous data... so NO MORE DATA LOSS



1:47:32  (SECOND example)
docker run --name app -d -p 8000:8080 --network tesla mylandmarktech/java-web-app .................. RUNNING IN THE tesla ntwrk
docker run --name webapp -d -p 7000:8080 mylandmarktech/maven-web-app *************** this is running in the default bridge ntwrk 


******************************** INSPECTING CONTAINER*****************************************
we can inspect the netwrk the container is running on by: 
docker inspect tesla    ( the ip address 172.18.0.4/16)
docker inspect bridge              (172.17.02/16
can also docker inspect tesla | grep 172
can also docker inspect bridge | grep 172    


                     CONNECTING CONTAINER TO A DIFF NETWRK
***************************1:56:00 
docker exec app ping webapp 
ping : unknown host because  the 2 containers (app) and (webapp) cannot communicate with each other bc they are in 2 different ntwrks
therfore:
ubuntu@docker:~$ docker network connect tesla webapp 
docker exec app ping webapp    ..... no response
ubuntu@docker:~$ docker exec -it webapp bash    ....... now we ar inside the (webapp)
root@3e143cbcde73:/usr/local/tomcat#
root@3e143cbcde73:/usr/local/tomcat# ping app ............... was sucesssful  **** we ar able to communicate wit the (app) container 1:58:20
root@3e143cbcde73:/usr/local/tomcat# ping springapp ................. was succesful aas well 

############ now we deleted the app cointainer and created it now in the bridge ntwrk 
docker run --name app -d -p 8000:8080  mylandmarktech/java-web-app 
docker exec -it webapp ping webapp bash
root@3e143cbcde73:/usr/local/tomcat# ping app   ............ we ping app now bt its nt successful bc containers that are  nt in the same ntwrk cant communicate wit each oda
ping : unknown host
docker network connect tesla app .. to connet it bk to the tesla ntwrk

QUESTION, Why is it not able to ping , thought thats one of the adv of custom ntwrk, if a container is recreated it can stil be in the same ntwrk bc it can connect with either 
IP addresss or container name and in this case, the cointainer was recreated with the same name. 
mY ANS: the app dat was deleted was recreated with the same name bt the netwrk wasnt stated, so that means it was recreated in the bridge netwrk nt the intial custom ntwrk



2:00:22     HOW TO ISOLATE APPLICATION USING DOCKER
BY placing the applications in diff ntwrks 
****null netwrkk**
If we create container in none/null network. Container will not have IP Address.
We can't access  containers in this network  Internal or external 
****************** we can use this ntwrk to isolate containers




2:01: 00********************** CAN A CONTAINEER BELONG TO MORE THAN ONE NTWRK ???????????
YES....
Docker netwrk create ebay 
docker network connect ebay app
docker inspect app | grep 172 ......................  now, we can see the several Gateways and IPAddress ie the dif ntwrks connected to  app container**************
                                 now app container has 3netwrks ie the default netwrk, the tesla ntwrk & the ebay ntwrk
therfore, docker exec -it webapp bash  ............................ SUCCESSFUL BT  before it wasnt succesful
root@3e143cbcde73:/usr/local/tomcat#
root@3e143cbcde73:/usr/local/tomcat# ping app  ....... SUCCESSFUL

                    2.09.00               CREATING DOCKER HOST NETWRK
***from docker3&4***** 2 containers CANNOT v the same host port number& name  , bt can v the same conatainer number
docker run --name containerName -d -p hostPort:containerPort image:tag
  -d = detachable mode  
  -p = port Forwarding


2) Docker Host Network.:
If we create containers in host network. 
Container will not have IP Address. and we cant do port forwarding -p
 Container will be created in a system network.


docker run --name webapp -d -p 7000:8080 mylandmarktech/maven-web-app 

 *****CREATING HOST NTWRK*********************************************

Number1 is the normal docker run command but  ***** when using host ntwrk, no need for -p , therfore no port forwardn bc it is in the host ntwrk as seen no.2
1)docker run --name webapp -d -p 7000:8080  mylandmarktech/maven-web-app



                                   DEPLOYING USING THE HOST NETWORK
   2.18.55   We can't create more than one container with d same container port in host network, except in the default bridge netwrk, bt we hv to do port publishing
         2.21.20   docker logs apps .. we see binding exception

2)docker run --name javaapp -d --network host mylandmarktech/java-web-app   
   ContainerPort: 8080                                                        ************ IT HAS ITS CONTAINER PORT 8080  
*********i can deploy the application & access it.


 2:12:00******now lets deploy another container called 'apps' with the same image
it has a containerport/number of 8080
                             
3)docker run --name apps -d --network host mylandmarktech/java-web-app    
 ContainerPort: 8080  
**if i deploy dis contianer with this same image,in the same host ntwrk, THIS WIL NT RUN 
It will not run because BC this image mylandmarktech/java-web-app, has a container port of 8080
   & when i used the image to deploy the first container 'javaapp' 8080 is in use
& bc this is host netwrk, WHATEVA PORT the container is having dats what wil be assigned to the host 
  
2.12.14                         
we can run the netstat -tulpn command to see the ports already in use.. when endusers ar tryin to acess this java-web-app, ie javaapps
now the host ntwrk is in use, we ar nt defining any port publishing bt when endusers traffic gets here,the container is running on the host ntwrk, therfore, 
it inherits the same port, its using the host ntwrk, so trafic wil b routed to the first container (javaapp) 

                                            
                                            PORT BINDING/ADDRESS BINDING
                             2.17.13  2containers with the same port cant run in the host netwrk
                            2.21.20   docker logs apps .. we see binding exception

2.15.00************ we run docker ps 
we see only the first container deployed in number2 above.
we run :docker inspect javaapp | grep 172.1    ..
we see the ip adresses
* to check the second container deployed in number3 above
 we run :docker inspect javaapp | grep 172.1    .....
but ders no IP address bc the container makes use of the host IP n dats why i cant deploy another container with the same port

       
2.16.22**********tryin to deploy anoda container with the same container port 
docker run --name hello-d --network host mylandmarktech/hello   ***** bt when we run docker ps , we cant see the container bc of port binding/address binding 
bc we cannot do port forwarding in the host ntwrk
******2.17.13., if it was in the custom bridge ntwrk we can do port forwarding  7000:8080, ie we are forwardng from the host port 7000 to port 80:80
when it in the host netwrk, we can do port forwarding & secondly the container does not have an ip address
therfore 2containers with the same port cant run in the host netwrk, it wont run


 ***** now we deploy another container with a diff container port & it works                                         
docker run --name hello -d --network host mylandmarktech/hello  *** this got a diff container port number thats why its working, 
ContainerPort: 80                                                                                                                       


                                         
                                         BRIDGE NETWORK
****mee*** in the default bridge netwrk, We can create more than one container with d same container port , bt we hv to do port publishing

2.18.17 
we need to do port publishing when you deploy in the default bridge netwrk
2.19.12 we nid to do port publish to access containers generally 

if we hv containers like this , they cannot be deployed in the host ntwrk , they can only be deployed in the bridge ntwrk
   landmark-web-app  = containerPort,  EXPOSE=8080  
   java-web-app      = containerPort,  EXPOSE=8080  
   maven-web-app     = containerPort,  EXPOSE=8080  


****online
Port publishing is the process of mapping a network port from a Docker container to a port on the Docker host (your computer), making a service inside
the container accessible to the host and the external network. It uses port forwarding or a proxy to redirect incoming traffic from the host's port to the 
container's internal port, allowing you to access containerized applications from your web browser or other tools. 
***mee**
Is port publishing & port forwarding the same?
No, "port publishing" and "port forwarding" are not always the same; port publishing is a type of port forwarding, specifically used to make a network service
inside a Docker container accessible from the host machine and potentially the external network. Port forwarding is a broader networking concept, 
also known as port mapping, that redirects network requests from an external IP address and port to an internal host's IP address and port.  




                                 DOCKER NONE/NULL NETWRK


3) Docker none/null network
========================
docker inspect none

If we create container in none/null network. Container will not have IP Address.
We can't access  containers in this network  Internal or external 
****************** we can use this ntwrk to isolate containers

docker run --network none                     
Internal or external 
cant be accessed Internal or external 

docker run --name hello -d --network none mylandmarktech/hello   

Isolation
  docker run --ebay host -d --name hello mylandmarktech/hello   
  docker disconnect hello ebay  
  docker connect hello none
