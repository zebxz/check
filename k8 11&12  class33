CONFIG MAP AND SECRETS

there aew 2kinds of appl we generally deploy in k8
stateless
stateful   : we always need to maintain its state bc it captures data and we nid to ensure the data is stored and retrievable and vol concept in k8 is what we can use to achieve
that process

we also realize that why we v dif option when it cm to vol der are some other imp aspect to consider like:
diff vol option:
secret
nfs
hostpath
azuredisk
configmaps

4:48
env variables are  like secret variable ,, because the  inf is stored in our source code mgt and so we shouldnt pass the env variable
