explain ur experience with jenkins, problems uve faced and work me tru your jenkins pipeline

ANS:  by student
Thank you for having me, my name is Cecilia Ekeh, i have over 5years experience as a devops engr and hv built a robust CI/CD and i stage my CI/CD frm 5stages thats from code ,
build, test, deploy, and monitoring . and my CI/CD pipeline i use declarative CI/CD pipeline in coporation with automation tools LIKE jenkins, maven, sonarqube, doker , ansible
kubeneterns, promethus and grafana and in that project i build a java web appl such that i create a github for the projectand in the project i mk sure that my developers submit
their code through the pull REQ such that if thers need for us to review the code we can easily review the code b4 we approve it and my github env i hv branching strategy such
that i have future branch, hot fix fix branch and prod branch such that if thers any issue wit the code we can create a future branch and after the issue is resolved , mayb
the client REQ we modify one of the features so that we can use the fix hot branch to fix it.
also in my git env, i conifgure my github web hook such that at anytime point in time thers a commit of code frm my developer to the github env, my webhook will push the code
to jenkins which will trigger a build which is still part of my continius intergration and also i use maven to build the code, compile, validate and run unit test cases on each
of the lines of the code and after the successful build i intergrate my maven wit jenkins which is part of my continous integration and bc we are very kin of the code we deploy
to prod so we use sonarqube for test the code quality against bug, vulneriblity, code smell after testing run tru the quality gate , then everybody can see it on the dashboard
also i use ansible for configuration, patching and upgrading of my webapp, after which i still integrate with my jenkins which is still part of my continous integration and 
after that i use docker for packiaging and containerizing of our appl aferwhich i use dockerfile to build the image and push the image to dockerhub and thats part of our 
continous deployment then i use k8 for container ochestration, and hv structured my k8 env such that i deploy to my name sapce bc if i dnt create a namespace the appl goes to 
default but i dnt wnat that bc i wnt to mk sure that k8 cl8 is well structured and well secured , i also create my metrix server to aggregrate resource utilization in the cl8
env and in my cl8 also i configure my loadbalancer and my database and i also inteegrate it with my jenkins which is the prod, ie continous delivery and for monitoring, i use
promethus and grafana to monitor how the appl is perfroming to ensure evryin is moving smoothly and deploying the appl according and thats hw i manage my CI/CD pipeline

*************
proff, i like your intro i have 5years experience using jenkins in my env, , these are typical questions you shud expect as far as jenkins is concerned and any other tool we 
hv done so far

TO YOU WHAT IS DEVOPS ?? 
***************

DEVOPS is not a tool, its a methodology the aim is to be able to achieve automation and continous improvement when it comes to software delivery and appl development, thats 
what devops is all about and bc its nt a tool, it uses  a set of tools , git for example for versioningbc when developers are developing appl that will be developed, ther
will be multiple version of that appl that will be created for the clients and how is that vsersions managed, so git is the open source software/tool that is able to track 
changes in the code so we use git for versioning, as a matter of fact we classify git as a ditributed vesrion control system, so devops is making use of multiple tools and 
git is one of them and not just git it also deals with source code mgt tool,ther are multiple tools , github, gitlab etc, so when it comes to managing the source code github is
involved
i must say here that in my env we are managing java based project, ofcourse project can be multiple languages be it python project, java script, be it  mpm, there are multiple
types of projects that could be managed 
from time to time, we manage other related projects but our main focus has been on java project and to that effect we are building this project after the devlopers hv wriiten 
the code, we are buiding it using a java based tool called maven , with the help of maven in our development process we can then do a build and all of this is part of the 
devops process bc to ease of all of these proceses we are nt just using maven directly bt we are using another devops tool that helps to automate the connection , it helps to 
connect/integrate the dot together and the tool is claled jenkins so with the help of jenkins once developers commit a new version of the appl in github, jenkins will pull the
new version of the appl and jenkins is connecting with mave to do a build,
and again, maven is a very powerful build tool and its open source, its an open source tool that will help us ensure that the code is well written, it validates the code, it 
checks the file structure, it ensures everyting was well done as expected and once its validated, it goes ahead to compile the java classes, after which it does unit test cases
and if the unit test cases passes in maven then the packages are created , so with a simple mpm package al of this is goin to be realised

AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT MAVEN CAN DO ALL  OF THIS ?

its possible bc maven makes use of pluggins, dependencies and with the help of this maven is able to validate the code, compile java classes, run unit test cases and able to 
create packages, so you see that when it comes to devops processes, deveops is all about improvement, so once it brings in maven, maven ensures that packages but it doent 
just end there, bc a good pipeline considers several factors including security, diaster recovery etc , so once maven informs us that these are packages created within our 
devops cycle, we hv a tool thats incharge of the code quality.called quality checker, which is sonarqube, sonarqube has been part of our project, it is part of our project, it
performs code quality analysis and establishes report that informs of the quality, ie, good,medium or poor quality but before that in our env we hv created our benchmark for
code quality called quality gates/profiles, our benchmark hv been created eg, for most our project our becnchmark is expected to be atleast 90%, which implies that developers
are expected to write atleast 9 out of 10 lines for test cases , so sonarqube wil be checking if this is what the developers actually did, so deveops with all of this, jenkins
is helping to connect all of this tool together to integrtae them together so with the help of jenkins we can achieve continous integration where once developers commit a code
and evrything is fine then artifacts are created
so this is what devops is all about, it stretches beyound that point bc once we hv sonarqube performing that task the nxt tin is that we hv our artifacts once sonarqube validates
and tell us that these are good code, the nxt tin is we nid to backup the artifact just inacse thers a disater and we use artifactries to be able to be upload our artifacts into
and in our env we use an open source artifactory called nexus and of course ther are other artifactries you could ude like jfork, amazon, ecr bt in our env we principally use
nexus for that purpose so once the artifcats are uploaded we are now reday for deployment and to deploy we get into a predeployment phase where we hv a  docker file which we 
use to containerise our appl bc we are basically managing containerized appl with the help of a docker file we are able to create images, share the imgaes in docker registry for
eg in our env we using dockerhub ....... 

************ so u must always speak as someone who is at work not one in the class u see when am speaking i want to tk u bk to my env, 

 and once the images are in dockerhub we no whv our container ochestra, we hv a tool we are using to ochetrate these containers which is called k8, so with the help of k8
our containers are created, scaled, managed, if thers a problem it comes to a self healing capability,  eg if theres a problem k8 will ensure that eg if a port went down 
since we always use controller mangers in our deployment, they will recretae the port , if a node goes down, all the pods running on that node will be evicted and automatically 
assigned to new node.. thats how we achieve our build release and deployment job , just bc we mk use of devops and devops helps use to be able to integrate with diff tools to
be able to achieve our objectives but we dnt only deploy the appl and end ther
we ask our selves whta happens if the appl goes down how are we goint o be made aware, how are we goin to be made informed, so still within our devops processes using automation
tool like jenkins we hv what is called continous monitoring , we hv to observe hw the appl is performing so contantly we are observing, is the appl perfroming well or not
how are we goin to know , so since we manage containerized appl in our env, we hv what is called promthus and grafana , and with this we deploy an apll monitoring tool kit 
that monitors all the appl and if thers a prob we will be allerted bc promethus comes with couple of micro services and one of them is the alert manger. we hv creatd alert manger 
eg if a pod is down an alert is down a alert will be triggered, if a node is down an alert is triggered, if a node is low on cpu or memory, an alert will be trigerred , we hv
configured all of this . when it comes to monitoring tha apll but this is not all , we want to also knw hw our appl are behaving, so we hv a log mgt appl in our ev equally 
called elastic search hybrid and kibana, it tells us how our appl are behaving , this is also deployed in our env, in all of this we also ensure that everything is done securely 
so continous securtiy is of eptical importance in our env

********** so if you ask me the question of what devops is all about it can take you to any level that you want to go, you can go any dirextion bt whatever direction u want to 
use the bottom line is that u just hv to ensure that your communication is intelligent as per what devops is all about


41:37
*********** 
what do you use for versiong??
you use git not github as 
we use github as a source code manager, the software used for versoning is git
github is a source code manger used for source code manger


WHAT ARE THE BSET GIT PROCESSES IN our env   ???

ANS:
 dnt tell us that w hv to make sure that, u are speaking abt what you do at work not what u were taught in sch
bc you are graduating as someone wth 5years working exp , not as soemone who has just done devops programm

you say in my env, i ensure this is happening , this is nt happening 


50:00
TELL US WHAT YOU USE GIT FOR 
ANS:
We use git for versoning and github as our source code manager
my experience includes git installation, i hv installed git on both linux and windows systems and if theres a problem hv been able to upgrade the version frm lower to higher 
version 
i hv able to mk use of git as a versioning tool, also made use of github as a source code mgT TOOL.
when it comes to my job we hv what is called git best practices in our project
the first get to do we us making us of the CLI over making use of the console so if w ehv a job to mange ther are 2options, either we go and modify the code directly frm the
repository which is nt recommended or u validate the code using an IDE, so 9 out of 10 we use and we recommend our developers to be making use of IDEs bc it simplifies their
job significantly 
also part of our best practices include branching strategy, here we maintain a minimum of3 develpoment line or 3 branch bc a branch is a line of development, and the 3
branches include the development,stage and master ,those are the 3 minimum branches that we maintain and it is worth noting that our env is configured such that if thers any
commit in the dev bracndh, it will trigger a job and the job will be built and deployed in the dev env, if thers any commit the stage, a job is triggered and it be deployed
in the testing or UAT env
if thers a commit in the master branch it wil be deploying that version in production,( which means that to acknowledge client) it is worth mentioning here that as part of
our branching strategy w ednt allow direct commit in the master branch, so we hv what is called branch protection and this is enforced such that you are not allowed to 
commit any code directly in the master branch , therfrore commit in the master branch only happens via a pull rEQ and the pull rEQ, one developer is asking her peers or 
other senior members of the development team to review the job they hv done n if they are satisfied they can merge in the master branch

its also worth mentioning that frm the master branch, it is possible most of the time that clients REQ a change, bc their REQ is dynamic and so we hv to create a feature 
branch frm the master, once that is done, the new feature is developed, changes are commited and it goes tru a peer review before it is merged in the master then we can 
delete the feature branch that was created

also it wort mentioning that there are times when we hv bugs/issue in the code, therfore we create a bugfix from the master so the master is the upstream and the is  bugfix 
is the downstream, so we create the bugfix, remove the bug , run test when evrytin is working as expected then we merge it bk to master

also as part of our branching strategy is to avoid conflict so we advice our developers please avoid conflict ie if ur hv to switch frm one branch to another , mk sure you 
finish your work in that branch, do all the commit that has to be done b4 switching branches but in situations whereby thers order frm above to sitch, we advice developers to
always backup their job if they must switch branches while their coding exercise is still in progress and indeed git has provided a very easy supoort for backup fromngitstast
command, with the help of the gitstash command, we can hv several backups


also as part of our gt best practices , as a devops engr, part of my task is to create teams in our github account and assign team members lik edevelopers are part of the team
other devops engr inclusding myself are part of the team, we hv our QA guys for testing, they are part of the team, when we create teams in our env we grant what we call least
priviledges to team members which implies that if somebody need to be working in the dev branch i cnanot just grant him access to all branchesbc that will result in security
vulnerability in our env we are very heavy on security and in our env we commnonly say that security is very inherent in our env thefrore team members are granted least 
priviledges 



1:28:48
the reason why those course was assigned to you was not for you to write exams frm it but was for you to understand the content just as our devops content is for content
mastery and we are nt graduating you as somebody who has been studing but as someonw who has been working
bc as an engr we always study bc we always do research so if uve been doing ur homework very well n researching of course your hands are ver very dirty with stuff

but do i need to get AWS ceritified solution architect to get a job?
the answer is you can still hv it but dnt get a job 
bc the main focus is what can you do  and what you can do is what you have been doing 

*** i:30 :20 
 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN IT , ( answering as one with 5years experience rather than just certification)

ANS:
Thank you for that question, personally am an addidct when it comes to IT, i consider myself an addicted IT profesional am so addicted to evrytin technology
and hv been working for microsoft for over 5years ,my main job is a devops engr, am helping them to mange their cloud env am like an applictaion specialist, so we build appl
we deploy them, they run on k8 clusters, i ensure the applications are scalable, i ensure they are secured, so i use pipeline to automate the entire processes so hv been 
exposed to multiple tools in my career including git for versoning, github for source code, including jenkins for CI/CD automation, including maven which we use to manage 
our java projects, maven helps us to do a build , we equally sonarqube for code quality, nexus for artifactory and whenevr our appl are built we want to containerize them
so in the quest for containerisation, we use docker for containerisation and k8 to ochestratet the containers, not just ochetration, i ensure the containers are running at
all times by having some tools that monitors my env , observe the appl and if ther is any incideence, i am aware , i get notified , (even my client notices) if thers any
problem i am notified, thats my experience, so my hands are very dirty with work



******** 1:33:53
HOW CAN YOU TAKE OUR COY TO THE NEXT LEVEL ..  ?? ?? 

ANS:
Thank you very much , my vision in IT is to be able to work with members of my team and to see hw we can take whatever process we are managing to its/their next level 
so bringing me together with the current team that you have, i bliv that taking whatever is been done there to the nxt level when it comes to software delivery, when it comes to 
to appl development, app mgt , i can guarantee you that we are goin to be taking the entire process to the nxt level 
 
SO HOW MANY CERTIFICATIONS DO YOU HAVE
Oh my God, hv been so busy with work , over whelmed with projects at work, hv nt had time to take exams but we always hv training , we invite , aws hv cm to the coy couple 
of times, we hv free accounts so am always studying, hv never had time to go and write exams 


**********  :33:40
SO TELL US HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT IF WE HIRE YOU  ....  ?

ANS:
just tell me your budget for this position, let me just know if your budget is within my expectation bc to hire a devops engr you need to hv a budget
so the coy needs to sit down and have a budget


2:09:39                     WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE IN JENKINS
****** 


THANK YOU so much MR STEVE AND your entire team
i am so exicted to talk abt my my exp as a devops engr , i hv over 5yrs exp working on jenkins and ther are quite a few things hv been able to do when it comes to jenkins 
the first thing hv done is hv been able to install and mange jenkin servers, hv configured jenkins server completely and when it comes to setting up my jenkins, i use ansible 
to be able to install my jenkins, so with the helpof anible paybk which i hv written i use the ansible playbk to install my jenkins once that is done, i configure the server
to ensure that jenkins is working properly and it is worth noting that for jenkins to work or even start, we need java, so b4 i hv jenkins installed in my playbk, one of the 
task is to install java, thats my first experience with java, installing the jenkins sevrer, configuring the server and ensuring that jenkins is working properly
****** EXperience number2:
i also hv exp where hv been task to upgarde my jenkins version eg upgarding frm verson 30 to 32
with that what hv done in the past is hv been tasked to recommission my jenkins server, so i hv to uninstall the old version of jenkins and reinstall the new version
also i hv been asked to secure the server and as part of jenkins security 2things hv i done, hv been able to change my jenkins default port from .8080. to .. 
not just changing the jenkins default port,i hv ensured that in my env we access our jenkins sever via a proxy, therfrore you dnt talk to jenkins server direclty, we use a 
webserver, an ngnix websever to access jenkins bc it is more secured, (if u want to access ur appl servers and u use a webserver in btw the proxy,its more secured)
so in my env hv been able to access my jenkins server using an ngnix webserver, that is part of the security
thats not all my experience in jenkins also includes running jobs, jenkin jobs ... eg 
i hv been able to craete simple free style project, hv also been able to create maven project bc most of the project we mange this projects are code that are developed in 
java and we use maven as a compiler, maven is used to do a build and those are maven projects which i hv deployed
hv also been able to deploy what we call, multi-line pipeline project that can be deployed to diff branches , if u do a commit in the dev branch it will trigger a job, also
if u do a comit in the stage as well. .. so hv beeen able to write pipeline that manges multi-line pipeline projects 
also hv been able to create pipeline jobs in jenkins uisng both sripted and declaractive pipelines, writing jenkins files, maintaining jenkins files thats my experience
my exprience buttresses and stresses a lot when it comes to writing and  maintaining jenkins files 
now once i hv the servers running, thers could be a problem, eg trying to do a uild but its failing , so what hv i been able to accomplish with that?
a spart of my experince hv been able to troubleshoot build failures, so if thers a problem in the build, i read the error messages, bc since jenkins has a console output
from theconsole output, you can see the log where ther was a problem, thats my experience, troubleshooting build failures in jenkins 
as part of my experience my task ahs always been to ensure that we automate everytin frm jenkins
talking abt automation in jenkins, in our env w ehv what is called the 7c, 

1) continous dev.: 
where we ensure that developers are constantly writing code, so in our env as part of that process, we are using git for versioning , github as our source code manger, 
develpers write their code and they commit it in the source code manager paltform which is github and with taht they can participate, collaborate and carryout the best 
software development exercise, so yes we hv continous development
2)we hv continous integration where wth the help of jenkins once the code are committed we can easily run a test on them and do a build, thats continous integration, 
3) we hv continous deliver where once the code are built w ecan now deploy them to production but b4 it is deployed to production, we first deploy to a test env called 
user acceptance testing, and manually we approve the deployment form UAT to production, that manual approval is what we call continuous delivery but again we hv some of our
internal projects which we use continous deployment where the process of deploying frm UAT to producion is automated, continous deployment
as part of continous deployment in our env one that appl has beeen deployed we must ensure that that the entire infrastructure  that the appl has runs on/ that is driving 
this appl is secured so we hv continous security , who manges the appl is imp to us so continously we are securing the end to end pipeline and our end to end appl and 
 development and mgt process , we call that in our env continous security 
As part of security we ant to ensure that this appl are runninf / functioning if thers any problem we are informed to take corrective actions , and we are able to do  this 
bc we hv whats called continous monitoring, so one of our jenkins job is a CM job that continously monitors the appl and if twer are incidences , alerts are sent, actions are
taken and those incidnces are correctd as expected

AS part of the 7c , we hv a job that we call continous provisoning , this is a job that , we hv a pipeline script wwcih is used to deploy our infrastructure , ie we can deploy
our entire infratructure like maven server, jenkins, ansible, our entire docker server , k8 using continous provisoning so w ehv a jenkins job that is been deployed on our 
terfrm space and that will craete our entire infarstuture , so we manage our infastructure , terafrm is managed frm jenkins , continous provisoning

* we also hv a job called continuos configuration mgt CCPM , this is used to continously configure our env , so frm jenkins we run playbks that manges our env

so thats my exp with jenkins
i run jobs in jenkins, dif type sof jobs, i ensure that the jobs are working as expected and i do this with the help of jenkins pluggins bc for jenkins to acheive its end to 
end task jenkins uses plugging ,,, plugging are certain software that once they are added/integrated with jenkins it makes jenkins to be more useful , technically we say that 
it extends its functionality, we use pluggins 

*** so my experience includes installing pluggins, updating pluggings ,reading the white papers about diff pluggins and how to better make use of pluggins thats my experience
in jenkins
we hv pluggings like job import pluggin eg lets assume we hv job in one jenkin server which we want to import into a new jenkins server
