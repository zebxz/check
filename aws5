vpc is my isolated ntwrk within aws that i can control
subnets are created inside our vpc
am able to create an instance e.g a web sever in my subnet 
vpc is a regional service in aws
i can create my subnet in us west-2a  avai zone 
subnet is an avail zone resource
vpc ar global reource
its nt advisable to launch all my subnets in the same avail zones
 i needed a vpc so it can enable me to create other subnets wher i can place my resources

when i hv a vpc i hv to create a cyber block
we wnt to det hw many subnets can a vpc hv
when we created our resources wit aws it came wit a default vpc created by aws
so we hv:
aws default vpc created by aws .. its nt adviceable to launch my servers in the default
17:20 aws custom vpcs created by the user.. this has more security and more contrl over my resources
so far we hv been using default vpc
the vpc we are creating wil be a regional service


in aws we have:
1 global resources
2 regional resource
3 avail zones resource 
subnets

3. 192.0.0.0/24      [192.0.0.0, 192.0.0.1, ..., 192.0.0.255 ]..... this is the best option bc we can get 200 addresses with 192.0.0.0/24 
4. 10.0.0.0/20
5. 172.0.0.0/16

the vpc has 256 addresses that can be didvided among its subnet

subnet1  = 10.0.0.0/25   = 128[ 0, 1, 2, ...      127  ] ... so for subnet2 , we wil start with 10.0.0.128/25 bc subnet1 ended with 10.0.0.127/25
subnet2    = 10.0.0.128/25   = 128 [128, 129, ..., 255 ]    

###### his calcualtion didnt correspond wit the automated result of aws.. i bliv  its is  10.0.0.0/24 =256 then u jst divide 256 by 4=64 ip address for each subnet

1:00:10 my s3 bucket canot be be created in a subnet, e.ginside us east2a subnet ..bc its a regional service i can create it in the us region inside my vpc e.g us east,us west
1:04:for e.g, if i v app server1 and app server2, to ensure comunication btw the servers, i can create a route table, wich detr hw service is routed from one subnet to d oda
 inside our vpc we nid internet gateway  it will allow internet to flow into the vpc & it wil allow exteral traffic so if we wnt to acess resourcs out of our vpc, out of our,
netwrk , we nid to hv internet , using IGW , ders a kind of internet gateway, it is associated wit our vpc.

1:07:00 inside the vpc we'l create route tables, route table1 for the private subnet to support local traffic within my vpc, then route table2, i hv a public subnet 
wich is wher i place resources wich can be acessed externaly & the route table2 is permitting traffic frm anywher . ie 0.0.0/0, both local& traffic frm the internet..

1:34:00 if my private app server is trying to access data online e.g ping google.com, il modify route table1, create a NAT gateway  to permit oneway internet traffic,therefore
the app server can access internet externally, i decide that we can recieve traffic frm the internet but can only happen frm the nAT gateway.
 the NAT will be created in the public subnet wich hv internet access,, from der, the private subnet is permitted to access internet via the NAT gateway

1:12:24 vpc has some firewall ,2 types of firewall, the first one stands infront of the subnet, like a gateman, netwk acess control list nACL... in naCL, we can create
some rule e.g open port80 for inbound rules &for outbound open port80 aswell,, we open port 443 as well, wit dis ports open, trafic frm enduser can get to my subnet
for  trafic to get to the webserver ,in front of my webserver thers another layer of security ie security group, so i v to open port80 , 443 
****** in  all we hv 2 security parameter
the 1st is the router for routing, wich permits traffic to be routed to the subnet
the 2nd is the firewall wich has 2layers of security,, security at the subnet level & security at the server level

1:20:40 ,, u cannot delete a vpc that has dependencies ie servers, u must delete the servers first
