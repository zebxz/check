when we do a build, the code will be packaged compiled and artifacts will be created, these packages can be jar/war/ear
before that can happen we are going to pull the code with the command gitpull/clone and once the build is done w ecan deploy the application to the application sever 


                                 APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT
which can of projects are we managing?
we are managing java based projects - projects that are developed in the java lanaguage



                                HOW TO DEPLOY JAVA BASED APPLICATION
If you have a maven-standalone-application 
you want to deploy the application? what we need is java

   java -jar appName.jar 
eg we have :    java -jar packageName.jar
    java -jar user-banking.jar 
  the java needed =    java openJDK 1.7+       (java development key 1.7+)
thats what we need to deploy a java stanalone application
we need java installed before the application can run

19:20

  To deploy maven-web-application  :
its actually java based web-application  : app.war / *.war / paypal.war          **** anyname at all but it must end with .war 
    the application must be deployed either to Tomcat server or 
     server running with JBoss/WildFly


  For maven-enterprise-application
if we are deploy a java based enterprise application  : then the application 
   should create artifacts the end with .ear  app.ear / paypal.ear  
  these applications can be deployed into  JBoss/WildFly



                                 WHAT IS AN APPLICATION SERVER?

An application server is a container upon which you can build and expose business logic and processes to client applications through various protocols including HTTP in 
a n-tier architect

                        Examples of servers
Apache Tomcat - Apache
Jboss/wildfly - Redhat
WEblogic - Oracle 
websphere Application Server - IBM 
Websphere liberty profile - IBM
Galssfish

                      HOW SHOULD WE EXPOSE APPLICATION TO USERS
The way we expose these applications to users is important


22:24
eg
60musers -----> boa.war        (using the bank of america app)
GitHub---->Maven[boa.war]---->appServer        (we hv 60m users)  need to access the application running in the appserver
80musers ------->  appServer


                                                 MULTI - TIER APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT

 multi-tier applications Deploment:

60mUsers ------> appServers 

We dont allow traffic from app users to get to the app servers directly because if it does, it will be a security bridge 
therefore we break down the deployment into 

                frontend tier                      and                        backend tiers
   which is our  webServers/LBTier (this stands in front)                   appTier      dbTier
 users(60m)                -->webServers/LB                            -->appServer-->database  
                                                              when users try to access their account they are eating their 
                                                                 userName/ Password/ addresses/
                                                                            SSN/DOB/tel

all these information needs to be stored in this database very sensitive information

                                                                                            http 443       apache httpd
                                                                                                          loadbalancer

                                                                                              (Frontend webserver/LB tier)

31:00
whatelse is the webserver doing?
lets assume that beyond the appserver, endusers are able to access this account and do diff transaction or create account when they do that they will enter their names, DOB,
email. All the date generated in this process has to be captured
whatever information the users enter/generate while accessing the app is captured in a database we access the information with the help of a database

 Our Appserver is Tomcat, we do not deploy to one appserver, so we have appserver 1,2,3 and for this process to be automated we need a tool called ansible. so when we do a 
build, with the help of ansible automating the process that is deploying the application to multiple appservers all of the servers have tomcat installed. 
now to expose this application to user and we have 60m user, these users need to access this application . traffic from this users need to get to the applictaion . traffic
 from from the the users is routed to the appserver but for us to manage how traffic is distributed to the appserver we will introduce a security tool which is a webserver, 
it can be an apache webserver ie httpd is installed . the webserver does load balancing. once it receives traffic from endusers, it will listen to the request and 
authenticate the user ifits the right user. our webserver will ensure that the appserver doesnt get traffic directly.
the webserver distributes the traffic evenly by balancing the traffic load it distributes to the appserver

multi-tier Application helps in high security because the way application are deployed they are highly secured

Backend tiers:
comes with high security = this is running in militarized zone = MZ
this includes application tier and database tier

 
   frontend tier  : Medium security = D-Militarised zone = DMZ
  Like the webservers, loadbalancers, jumpservers
    

 38:57

we dont route traffic from the endusers directly to the appuser we dont allow endusers to access the application directly because if it is accesssed directly there can be
a security breach which is highly risky.

so inbetween the appservers and users we place the webserver/lb therefore to access the appserver, it is routed through the webserver/lb
this system is highly secured

40:00
when traffic comes from enduser, the webserver expects traffic to come on http or 443, so the webserver is listening for the request from users. when ths users are trying
to access the appserver they are making some request on the port number either 80 or 443 while the webserver is listening for the request to determine if its from the right
user. if its the right user, it will authenticate the user and route the traffic but if the user is not authenticated it wont route the traffic
