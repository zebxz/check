***** we have installed tomcat and seen how we can use tomcat to deploy applications
we have seen how to install a server and call it a maven server by installingthe maven software and also installing a server and call it a tomcat server by installing 
the tomcat software on the server
we also saw how to grant gui access, so someone can manage our tomcat server from gui by configuring and setting up the server



***** session with engr armstrong , think he was helping me troubleshoot tomcat   ( I copied this from my maven 1a note)

          WHY DO WE START TOMCAT BUT NOT MAVEN 

We start tomcat because its a software that is accessible in the internet/browser and it has to be accessible because customers need to utilize the apps in tomcat server
but maven is a build tool, nothing is coming in or going out , maven doesnt listen to/on any port . it can do builds, change codes from machine readable to human readable
maven is not accessible on the internet , it uses just port 22and our server is ready to build.

we also access sonar qube, jenkins on the internet/browser because people need to see that ecerything that is required for the code is successful





               START

when we do a build, the code will be packaged compiled and artifacts will be created, these packages can be jar/war/ear
before that can happen we are going to pull the code with the command gitpull/clone and once the build is done w ecan deploy the application to the application sever 


APACHE TOMCAT
Tomcat or Apache Tomcat is a light weight, open source web container  used to deploy & run java-based web application.
it is developed by Apache software foundation (ASF)


WHAT IS WEBSERVER?
A webserver is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol to serve web content (HTML and static content) to users.

Examples;
Apache HTTP server
Nginx (pronounced engine X) 
IBM HTTP server (IHS)
Oracle iplanet web server
Internet information Server (IIS)

                                 APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT
which kind of projects are we managing?
we are managing java based projects - projects that are developed in the java lanaguage



                                HOW TO DEPLOY JAVA BASED APPLICATION
If you have a maven-standalone-application 
you want to deploy the application? what we need is java

   java -jar appName.jar 
eg we have :    java -jar packageName.jar
    java -jar user-banking.jar 
  the java needed =    java openJDK 1.7+       (java development key 1.7+)
thats what we need to deploy a java stanalone application
we need java installed before the application can run

19:20

  To deploy maven-web-application  :
its actually java based web-application  : app.war / *.war / paypal.war          **** anyname at all but it must end with .war 
    the application must be deployed either to Tomcat server or 
     server running with JBoss/WildFly


  For maven-enterprise-application
if we are deploy a java based enterprise application  : then the application 
   should create artifacts the end with .ear  app.ear / paypal.ear  
  these applications can be deployed into  JBoss/WildFly



                                 WHAT IS AN APPLICATION SERVER?

An application server is a container upon which you can build and expose business logic and processes to client applications through various protocols including HTTP in 
a n-tier architect

                        Examples of servers
Apache Tomcat - Apache
Jboss/wildfly - Redhat
WEblogic - Oracle 
websphere Application Server - IBM 
Websphere liberty profile - IBM
Galssfish

                      HOW SHOULD WE EXPOSE APPLICATION TO USERS
The way we expose these applications to users is important


22:24
eg
60musers -----> boa.war        (using the bank of america app)
GitHub---->Maven[boa.war]---->appServer        (we hv 60m users)  need to access the application running in the appserver
80musers ------->  appServer


                                                 MULTI - TIER APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT

 multi-tier applications Deploment:

60mUsers ------> appServers 

We dont allow traffic from app users to get to the app servers directly because if it does, it will be a security bridge 
therefore we break down the deployment into 

                frontend tier                      and                        backend tiers
   which is our  webServers/LBTier (this stands in front)                   appTier      dbTier
 users(60m)                -->webServers/LB                            -->appServer-->database  
                                                              when users try to access their account they are eating their 
                                                                 userName/ Password/ addresses/
                                                                            SSN/DOB/tel   



34:08

all these information needs to be stored in this database very sensitive information






24:00
                                                                                                      Backend appserver Tier          db Tier

                                                                                              (Frontend webserver/LB tier)

31:00
whatelse is the webserver doing?
lets assume that beyond the appserver, endusers are able to access this account and do diff transaction or create account when they do that they will enter their names, DOB,
email. All the date generated in this process has to be captured
whatever information the users enter/generate while accessing the app is captured in a database we access the information with the help of a database


24:00
 Our Appserver is Tomcat, we do not deploy to one appserver, so we have appserver 1,2,3 and for this process to be automated we need a tool called ansible. so when we do a 
build, with the help of ansible automating the process that is deploying the application to multiple appservers all of the servers have tomcat installed. 
now to expose this application to user and we have 60m user, these users need to access this application . traffic from this users need to get to the applictaion . traffic
 from from the the users is routed to the appserver but for us to manage how traffic is distributed to the appserver we will introduce a security tool which is a webserver, 
it can be an apache webserver ie httpd is installed . the webserver does load balancing. once it receives traffic from endusers, it will listen to the request and 
authenticate the user ifits the right user. our webserver will ensure that the appserver doesnt get traffic directly.
the webserver distributes the traffic evenly by balancing the traffic load it distributes to the appserver

multi-tier Application helps in high security because the way application are deployed they are highly secured

Backend tiers:
comes with high security = this is running in militarized zone = MZ
this includes application tier and database tier

 
   frontend tier  : Medium security = D-Militarised zone = DMZ
  Like the webservers, loadbalancers, jumpservers
    

 38:57

we dont route traffic from the endusers directly to the appuser we dont allow endusers to access the application directly because if it is accesssed directly there can be
a security breach which is highly risky.

so inbetween the appservers and users we place the webserver/lb therefore to access the appserver, it is routed through the webserver/lb
this system is highly secured

40:00
when traffic comes from enduser, the webserver expects traffic to come on http or 443, so the webserver is listening for the request from users. when ths users are trying
to access the appserver they are making some request on the port number either 80 or 443 while the webserver is listening for the request to determine if its from the right
user. if its the right user, it will authenticate the user and route the traffic but if the user is not authenticated it wont route the traffic

                                              TOMCAT INSTALLATION
43:40

                  
Tomcat Installation:
---------------------
https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/package-management/blob/master/Tomcat-installation/READme.md
https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.80/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.80.zip



58:30 

          https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/package-management/tree/master/Tomcat-installation
   

1:03

change hostname
shange shell
cd opt
install = sudo yum install git wget unzip -y
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk- devel -y
to verify = java -version
install tomcat: 
sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.89/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.89.zip
sudo unzip apache-tomcat-9.0.89.zip
sudo rm -rf apache-tomcat-9.0.89.zip
### rename tomcat for good naming convention
sudo mv apache-tomcat-9.0.89 tomcat9 
### assign executable permissions to the tomcat home directory
sudo chmod 777 -R /opt/tomcat9
sudo chown ec2-user -R /opt/tomcat9                   ********** ( but we did 775)
change user to avoid access denied
now when we ll, we can see  user has changed from root to ec2user
### start tomcat
ls, cd tomcat9/, pwd, ls, ls bin/
in the bin dir these are files we can use to start tomcat
eg
catalina.sh, startup.sh
so to start tomcat = sh/opt/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh


cd opt, cd tomcat9

1:09
with the symbolic path we dnt have to cd tomcat9 to start or stop tomcat we can start & stop from anywhere


1:11:00
****** the difference between
[ec2-user@tomcat tomcat9]$ sh /opt/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh
this is the absolute path atarting the root directory

          WHILE
[ec2-user@tomcat tomcat9]$ sh startup.sh (says no such file or dir)
this is the relative path starting the pwd
                                                  
                                              1:12:22
As path of our tomcat installation we are going to create a link to stop & start tomcat from anywhere 
sudo ln -s /opt/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh /usr/bin/starttomcat     **(this can be any name at all)
sudo ln -s /opt/tomcat9/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/bin/stoptomcat

so we can run = starttomcat to start
               OR = stoptomcat  to stop


when i run ls, i get a respnse because a symbolic path has been created


2:18
the bin dir is where we are suppose to run start and stop  but because of the symbolic link we can start from pwd


then sudo su -ec2-user                        ********* if you want to access this server its going to be on port 80:80, so we check from our CLI if tomcat is running by
                                                  curl -v OR local host curl -v local host:8080 public ip 80:80 
1:14:22                                                                                                      tomcat server
to verify if tomcat is running : we need the ip address &portnumber of :
Tomcat publicIP =  34.219.51.216 
 Tomcat portNumber = 8080  
so we can access this server on port 8080
now we can in our CLI check if tomcat is running or not by running the curl verbose to get a response
the curl -v 34.219.51.216:8080   
 OR                                   
                                 in verbose
We can check on local host =  curl -v localhost:8080 
To check on our browser  = 34.219.51.216:8080   
and also to access our tomcat server on the browser


**** from commandline ie mobaxterm check our local environment , curl localhost 8177 to check if someone from outside can access our server 
curl public ip:8177


                                        TOMCAT HOME DIRECTORY

                                      

  Tomcat Home directory - THD = /opt/tomcat9
THD: The Tomcat Home Directory is 
     where the tomcat software is extracted 
      we used wget to download tomcat  
      and unzip  to extract


                                           EXPLAINING THE CONTENT OF THE THD

when we ls, we see bin, conf, lib, logs, webapps, temp

 bin :
ls bin/ contains:
    bin: --- binary files  (important files like )
      startup.sh    --->  for LINUX SYSTEM
      startup.bat   ---->  for  WINDOWS OS
      shutdown.sh
      shutdown.bat     ----> for WINDOWS OS
      catalina.sh start
      catalina.sh stop | start | restart | status  
      version.sh
      version.bat           
    

1:22
ls conf /  vi conf/server.xml to view conf file

conf: 

eg of files in conf:
     server.xml          
      tomcat-users.xml, users.xml for those that work in the bank
               contains configuration information about tomcat server, any changes can be done here

 webapps:
      we effect deployments in Tomcat in the webapps Directory
       if you want to deploy in tomcat, its where deployment is taking place 
      The default deployment Directory in Tomcat is = webapps 
       therfore all the war files
      like maven-web-app.war created from # mvn package 
       we have to copy to the webapps dir because thats where deployment takes places 
        cp *.war /webapps
        cp *war   /opt/tomcat9/webapps/maven-web-app.war


    lib :
        contain all the jar files

    logs :   contains log files
      catalina.out
      host-manager.log


IQ:  What are the log files available in the tomcat log dir?
      catalina.out                     ****** check here if tomcat is not running
      host-manager.log        
   

                                          HOW TO VERIFY IF TOMCAT SERVER OR PROCESS IS RUNNING 

AFTER INSTALLING TOMCAT

    Verify if the tomcat service/process is running:
   We can run the :
    ps -ef | grep tomcat  
    telnet localhost 8080 
    curl -v localhost:8080 
    curl -v publicip:8080
    curl -v 34.219.51.216:8080
    curl -v 34.219.51.216:8177


 to install tomcat: sudo yum install telnet




               HOW TO CHANGE PUBLIC IP OF TOMCAT SERVER
    ***** whenever we change anything in the config file we have to restart tomcat

Ticket:
  Change the default portNumber for tomcat from 8080 to 8177 

Absolute path is 
vim or vi  /opt/tomcat9/conf/server.xml

to install vim :sudo yum install vim


1:32:50
then once we vi or vim /opt/tomcat9/conf/server.xml
we go to section "connector" and change 8080 to 8177
then stop and restart tomcat


1:31:17
       ***** whenever we change anything in the config file we have to restart tomcat



1:33:13                          TO ACCESS TOMCAT AS A USER  
                         (BY default you can only access and manage tomcat as a local host)


 public ip: 8177     on our browser
then click on manage App
it shows its 403 error - Access denied

1:35:46
so we have to conf tomcat server

1) enable external tomcat mgt access
vi or vim  /opt/tomcat9/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
this file is permitting tomcat to be managed as local host
showing , allow = "127\.df, which only allows broadcast /traffic from local host
 therfore we comment the line above by inserting <!--
                                                  -->


   By commenting the line, it means that i am changing the configuration such that other traffic can be allowed into my tomcat server

now once we try to public ip: 8177 on our browser its asking for username the password


guess this is setting up
2) next we create tomcat user with access roles:
vi or vim  /opt/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-user.xml             # to add user


1:40

a) <user username = "cecilia" password = "admin123" roles = "manager-gui admin -g
  ceceilia has manger role ie he can manage from the gui(graphic user interface) he has admin while simon has admin gui
b<user username = "simon" password = "admin123" roles = "admin- gui"/>

****** imputing username :Cecilia and password admin123, i can log in



                  HOW TO DEPLOY IN TOMCAT 
                                                                                   i have to rewatch to undertand what i meant i 
ls   /opt/tomcat9//webapps                                              ******** i)By uploading artifacts we can get the artifacts in our server and upload it
once i log in as manager on my public ip:8817 on my browser
webapps directory                                                       
in WAR files to deploy: i can choose my war file and deploy
                                (maven web app)
once we click deploy, it copies the file into the webapp dir 
and in our list of application on public ip :8817 which is our gui, we can see the file we choose anddeployed (maven web app)
ie this application has been deployed in tomcat, in the webapps dir

******* if its on my tomcat server i can just remove it from one server location 


1:49:15
            DePLOYING FROM SERVER TO SERVER (Maven to tomcat)

option2)    which we ll use most of the time 
we want to deploy the app from maven to tomcat 
we want to copy the file from our build server to tomcatserver

secure copy
if my server is not password authentication enabled
we run the scp command in maven                                  
scp -i c32.pem  target/*war ec2-user@tomcat public ip:/opt/tomcat9/webapps/
if password authentication is enabled
 we run this:   scp target/*war ec2-user@34.219.51.216:/opt/tomcat9/webapps/  




in our maven server 
to access my maven server 
1) in mobaxterm, i opened another tab and cd documents where my key is 
2) ssh -i key 33.pem ec2-user@maven public ip
3) git clone https://github.com/landmark technology/maven-web-application
4) cd maven web application
5) copy our tomcat server in maven 
scp traget/*war ec2-user@publicip:/opt/tomcat9/webapps
But we got permission denied


1:57:46
     WE ASSIGN PASSWORD TO MAVEN SERVER  ( bY COnfiguring password authentication)
1) so we  vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and change paswd authentication fron no to yes
2) then we restart  server: sudo suystemctl restart sshd
3) then sudo password ec2-user = Admin123

 Tomcat is the receiving server, so it has to have password authenticated for it to work 
because we are trying to access our tomcat using password so 
we have to config paswd authentication in tomcat


    CONFIGURE PASSWD AUTHENTICATION IN TOMCAT
1) sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    change password authentication no to yes
2) sudo systemctl restart sshd
3) assign password
     sudo password username : Admin123


2:04:00

cd opt

                    TO DEPLOY APPLICATION IN TOMCAT
1) watch ls  /opt/tomcat9/webapps/
2) we go back to maven server and run scp target/* war            **************  we were able to deploy in tomcat using the scp command 
and it will now request for password : Admin123
Now we can see 'tesla.war" above 
3) Now we go back to tomcat server and in our 'watch' we can see  tesla.war
4) also, if we check our tomcat gui on my browser, i also see teslar.war in my list of applications 


**************
 2:07:10

   scp -i' key33.pem
i want to copy a file found in the target dir
the file name is tesla.war
i want to idnetify myself in the receiving server as ec2-user
my public ip for tomcat server is 3.90.51.187                                       
the path to where the file will be deployed: /opt/tomcat9/webapps/app.war"              ****** the file name is app.war  & *** the env we are deploying to webapps dir
  it is converting tesla.war to app.war




   To DEPLOY USING SSH KEY FOR AUTHENTICATION
i) vi key33.pem
ii) chmod 400 key33.pem
ii) scp -i key33.pem target/tesla.war ec2-user@3.90.51.187:/opt/tomcat/webappps/app.war
when we check list of application on gui we can see app



2:22 
***********  to mg8 my sever/system bc server is a system 
       df -h : how much file system you have terms of storage 




                       HOT FIX
ls /opt/tomcat9/webapps/
ls /opt/tomcat9/webapps/tesla
ls /opt/tomcat9/webapps/tesla/jsps/
then vi /opt/tomcat9/webapps/tesla/jsps/
scroll to the section where the caption needs connection and change it

on the list of application
we can stop, reload, undeploy 

we undeploy it means we want to delete the application code (app app.war) from the web app dir
2:15:4   ie when you deploy it copies the war file into the webapp dir and unpack it
unpack: ie when we copied the file we copied maven web app but when it goes to web apps it extract it, so when you do deploy you are copying this war file into the webapp
dir and when it gets there its a automatically extracted which means it is unpacked.

when we deploy 
ls /opt/tomcat9/webapps/
app app.war does examples host-manager manager maven-web-app maven-web-app ROOT tesla  teslar.war

                                   AWS/GCP/AZURE/ONPREM 
 Redhat  linux server   >>>      ec2 Redhat! address     !    }
                                 instance  !  ports      !    }  this is the cloud environment
Software   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>       tomcat9   !   o-65536   !    }


1) example of cloud providers can be launched in : aws
2) Gcp
3) Azure

  OR i can own my on system and called it onprem system 
a) once i launch my server 
****** then i give myserver a name  1) the name of my server can be ec2Redhat instance                 ****redhat is a linux server
3) i install a tomcat9 software 
4) the server comes with addresses and they are called ports 
the point range is from 0-65536 for any server created  either windows , linux, etc


2:31:30
port number or server addresses:

    80  -- http     , Hyper text  transfer protocol
    443 -- https
    8080 -- Jenkins / Tomcat  / JBoss
    0-1024 -- Reserve ports
    1025-65535  
    465 --- SMTP
    587  --- SMTP
    22   --- ssh
    23   -- ftp
a server has 65536 ports/addresses    


on our security  grp  you can open a port or choose not to source from a particular        
we open address by using securing and firewall (firewall rules)  in AWs they are called security groups 

2:33
if you choose number of address and you want to accept traffic if the traffic listen on 
if a traffic needs a particular port number, that number must be in existence . it must be open before the traffic can flow in 


                         CAN WE  RUN TOMCAT AND MAVEN IN ONE SERVER

YEs you can but its  not recommended because it can lead to one single point of failure ie if maven server is down, tomcat also goes down , if tomcat has a problem, 
maven is also down 


                            HOW TO IMPROVE TOMCAT SERVER PERFORMNACE 

1) multiple request on a single tomcat server will affect performance
2)  Multiple deployments will reduce tomcat server performance.
  therefore its recommended  tohave multiple tomcat server 
3) The resource level or computing capacity OF your tomcat server   
     8GB RAM,   480GB Hard drive HDD  is better than 64GB RAM,  4000GB Hard drive SSD   

  2:39:10
4) HDD hard drive  is/are of less performnace than SSD

5) HEAPSIZE 
  We can increase the heapsize of the server 
Normally, tomcat by default allocates 64mb but we can increase to 128mb/256mb
  heapsize = 64mb -- 128mb/256mb    




***** session with engr armstrong

    you always have to starttomcat

                                       WHY DO WE START TOMCAT BUT NOT MAVEN 

We start tomcat because its a software that is accessible in the internet/browser and it has to be accessible because customers need to utilize the apps in tomcat server
but maven is a build tool, nothing is coming in or going out , maven doesnt listen to/on any port . it can do builds, change codes from machine readable to human readable
maven is not accessible on the internet , it uses just port 22and our server is ready to build.

we also access sonar qube, jenkins on the internet/browser because people need to see that ecerything that is required for the code is successful


  ******* 
 chmod 400 always
then if using terminal  -sshh ikey33.pem @ec2user: public ip OR copy command from AWS in connect
 then starttomcat 
then curl localhost 
then curl ifconfig 


Ls /opt/tomcat9 = bin conf webapps




   SUMMARY 

1) Install tomcat
2) verify if tomcat is running
3) if it can receive   curl ifconfig.me    |curlifconfig.io
4) RBAC - role based  accesss control 
 tomcat - user.xml file 
 simon  (username/passwd/ roles)
 dominion 
landmark 
5) copy: scp/ scp:
           but if you first copy to the home of tomcat server 
7:35     = scp target /tesla.war landmark @ 18:234.79:/ home ec2-user
          you will still have to copy it to the webapps dir to deploy 
         = cp  /home /ec2-user/teslar.war/opt/tomcat9/webapps

6) performing hot fixes
   vi /opt/tomcat9/webapps/app/jsps/home.jsp

7) enhancing/ turning up the performance of our tomcat servers by increase ing the heap size


   24:30
   WEBSERVERS: eg  nginx , apache 
    this is used to serve static content & images 
   we use webservers to server webcontent to user 



       TICKET 0014   nginx , Apache  http 
   write a script  to deploy apache webserver 


installing apache as the rootuser  = sudo - i 
vi apache.sh  & create a script ( webserver installation) 


  this script will start, enable & verify if apache is running or not 

  #!/bin/sh
# install apache as the admin/root user  
sudo yum install httd -y 
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd 
echo devops is good  >> /var/www/html/index.html                        ****** copy to a file called index.html
if i want to write the above a an html code 
17:50   echo <h1> and easy with landmark  </h1>   >> /var/www/html/index.html
mkdir  /var/www/html/google 
echo  <h1> landmark  google  </h1> >> / var/www/html/google/index.html            ***** save some web content in google dir 
systemctl status httpd 
ps -ef |  grep httpd 


23:30
  sh apache.sh to run the script
   curl localhost  : shows us - devops is good 
   curl  localhost  google

26:30 http://public ip/      }    each command gives a diff result 
& http:// public ip/ google  }
