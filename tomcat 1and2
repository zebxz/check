when we do a build, the code will be packaged compiled and artifacts will be created, these packages can be jar/war/ear
before that can happen we are going to pull the code with the command gitpull/clone and once the build is done w ecan deploy the application to the application sever 


                                 APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT
which can of projects are we managing?
we are managing java based projects - projects that are developed in the java lanaguage



                                HOW TO DEPLOY JAVA BASED APPLICATION
If you have a maven-standalone-application 
you want to deploy the application? what we need is java

   java -jar appName.jar 
eg we have :    java -jar packageName.jar
    java -jar user-banking.jar 
  the java needed =    java openJDK 1.7+       (java development key 1.7+)
thats what we need to deploy a java stanalone application
we need java installed before the application can run

19:20

  To deploy maven-web-application  :
its actually java based web-application  : app.war / *.war / paypal.war          **** anyname at all but it must end with .war 
    the application must be deployed either to Tomcat server or 
     server running with JBoss/WildFly


  For maven-enterprise-application
if we are deploy a java based enterprise application  : then the application 
   should create artifacts the end with .ear  app.ear / paypal.ear  
  these applications can be deployed into  JBoss/WildFly



                                 WHAT IS AN APPLICATION SERVER?

An application server is a container upon which you can build and expose business logic and processes to client applications through various protocols including HTTP in 
a n-tier architect

                        Examples of servers
Apache Tomcat - Apache
Jboss/wildfly - Redhat
WEblogic - Oracle 
websphere Application Server - IBM 
Websphere liberty profile - IBM
Galssfish

                      HOW SHOULD WE EXPOSE APPLICATION TO USERS
The way we expose these applications to users is important

60musers -----> boa.war        (using the bank of america app)
GitHub---->Maven[boa.war]---->appServer        (we hv 60m users)  need to access the application running in the appserver
80musers ------->  appServer

multi-tier applications Deploment:

                                      SSN/DOB/tel   

multi-tier applications :
  backend tiers :

IQ:  What are the log files available in the tomcat log dir?
      catalina.out

    webapps:
      we effect deployments in Tomcat in the webapps Directory
      The default deployment Directory in Tomcat is = webapps 
        war files
        maven-web-app.war  # mvn package 
        maven-web-app

 Verify if the tomcat service/process is running:
    ps -ef | grep tomcat  
    telnet localhost 8080 
    curl -v localhost:8080 
    curl -v 34.219.51.216:8080
    curl -v 34.219.51.216:8177
Ticket:
  Change the default portNumber for tomcat from 8080 to 8177 

  vim /opt/tomcat9/conf/server.xml  
      <Connector port="8177" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"

configure tomcat server:
 1.  Enable external tomcat mgt access
     vim /opt/tomcat9/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

from:
  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
          allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /

2. create tomcat users with access roles  :
vim /opt/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml  =# to add user
vi /opt/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml

<user username="landmark" password="admin123" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui,manager-script"/>

How to improve tomcat server performance?
  Multiple deployments will reduce tomcat server performance.
  Multiple requests on a single tomcat server will affect performance
  The resource level or computing capacity OF   your tomcat server   
    SERVER1 =  8GB RAM,   480GB Hard drive HDD 
    SERVER2 =  64GB RAM,  4000GB Hard drive SSD   

  01 appServer  
  10 appServers  

  heapsize = 64mb -- 128mb/256mb
