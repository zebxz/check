**** why are we nt downloaidng maven directly on our windows, why are we installing in AWS EC2 Redhat Instance.





1) Ticket_maven-001    .....  ***************** DONE
Install Maven on a RedHat Linux 9 Server  

2. Java is a pre-requisite for maven to run 
    JRE --> JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT
    JDK --> JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT 1.8+
            JVM will also be installed      (once java is installed, this installs automatically)

 43:30
we already hv some notes in our githubwhich we can use for maven installation , package management, maven installation


mavenHomeDir = M2_HOME = /opt/maven :


STEP4 :

SEt environmental variable for specific user eg ec2-user
ls -a  /home/ec2-user/
vi ~/.bash_profile    and add lines below
export M2_HOME=/opt/maven
export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin



STEP5: 
    Refresh the profile and verify if maven is running
source ~/.bash_profile
  To see if maven has been installed: mvn - version



In maven we are running the "mvn package" command bc in maven we are building package, when we run the command
it creates the packages in the target directory
ls target/*jar = to list my jar file
target/maven -stanalone-application -0.0.1-snapshot.jar


mvn install goal .........
the package will be  created in target dir and also, we are installing the packages in maven local repository; ie the .mlr repo" we created earlier
WHILE mvn package ONLY creates the package in target dir 



maven has a goal called the clean rule 
== mvn clean: delete everything in the target directory
rm -rf is also an option but mvn clean is better


1:11:40
mvn clean package
will clean the old artifact and create new one

but

mvn package clean create the artifact and clean will clear/ delete the artifact that it just created

**** we use mvn package to create artifacts




 How do you secure the maven local repo 
 sudo vi /opt/maven/conf/settings.xml    **** we vi and create a custom maven repo
***we can aslo : sudo echo "<localRepository>/home/ec2-user/.mlr</localRepository>">> /opt/maven/conf/setting
so we want to echo this information, we are redirecting to this file .. /opt
 if you run it the first time it will work but if you try to change it again it will be a problem 
so vi/ng into the file is the best

         TO SET OUR TIME

2:35                      our time is not correct lets set it 

             to set our time zone
timedatectl list-timezones
sudo  timedatectl list-timezones         **** to get the diff time zones  ( the time zone u want to change to must be listed on the time zone list for it to be changed)
 to set a time zone :  sudo  timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York


MAVEN2
but what can be done for maven to still do a build if a (1)test fails
           mvn package -DskipTests OR mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
           This will skip the testing processing


linux command  rm -rf but mvn clean is better
mvn clean will delete the artifacts in our target dir but will not delete the artifacts in maven local repo
mvn clean will delete everyfile in target dir 


how can we trouble -shoot a fail build in MAVEN ??
Check the logs to understand the errors
mvn - x package (BUILD in debugging mode) This will build in debugging mode
