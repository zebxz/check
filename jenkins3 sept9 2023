 ******** continuation of Ticket 002  from video2

we dont have webhook integration with sonarqube but sonarcloud

***** Always remember to change tomcat url in jenkins container and snapshot/url in pom.xml releases


58:46, i tried catalina but it says no such file/dir

  1:27:14  ..... task to do                           


                                   

                                              START

  AUTOMATING BUILD IN JENKINS 


25:00
D)
Jenkins Nexus Integration;  mvn deploy:
======================================
Upload build artifacts:
http://34.217.27.159:8081/    

i. Install, configure and start the nexus nexus server  
   https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/package-management/tree/master/nexus-installation

11. Create releases and snapshots artifactory repositories in nexus-UI for artifacts upload  
   http://34.217.27.159:8081/  
        default-username = admin  
        default-password = admin123
    http://34.217.27.159:8081/repository/tesla-releases/ 
    releases artifactories is use to upload artifacts when build is from the master branch 

    http://34.217.27.159:8081/repository/tesla-snapshots/
    snapshots artifactories is use to upload artifacts when build is from the dev branch

iii. modify 'distributionManagement' tag with nexus repos details  in  pom.xml in github
        vi pom.xml
        distributionManagement>
then in jenkins server 
configure -Add build step- invoke top level maven
version :maven 3.9.4 - Goal deploy , then save and build now 

*********** from jenkins jenkins our prod is 
/var/lib/jenkins
ls
we see tools and other files
ls tools 
hudson.task


44:20
 he ran sudo su-jenkins but it didnt change so he ran sudo vi /etc/passwd and changed false to bash
change the jenkins server shell to /bin/bash


   <distributionManagement>
      <repository>
        <id>nexus</id>
        <name>Landmark Technologies Releases Nexus Repository</name>
        <url>http://34.217.27.159:8081/repository/tesla-releases/</url>

47:34
iv. modify /maven/conf/setting.xml in JENKINS-server with nexus login credentials  
   =# vi /nexus/conf/setting.xml          ******(Relative path)
    http://34.217.27.159:8081/

vi /var/lib/jenkins/tools/hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation/maven3.9.4/conf/settings.xml

******* before the server closing tag, we add another server details 
add under the arrow 
<servers> nexus-admin-admin123 then we can go to jenkins and click configure 
then check nexus server to see the created artifacts



            <server>
                <id>nexus</id>
                <username>admin</username>
                <password>admin123</password>
            </server>


v. Open required ports[8081] in Nexus server firewall/SG to allow traffic from jenkins server



1:01

6. Jenkins tomcat Integration   :
============================= 
 This is required for web application Deployment in the tomcat webapps directory
i. Your tomcat server must be confired and running.   

  On CLI : 
     curl -v 34.219.51.216:8080  

On browser:
     http://34.219.51.216:8080 

OR: grep
     ps -ef | grep tomcat  
     # Start tomcat if not running             ********* with my symbolic path i run starttomcat
     sh startup.sh  
     sh /opt/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh  
     sh catalina.sh start   
     sh /opt/tomcat9/bin/catalina.sh start 

   http://34.219.51.216:8177/ 
     curl -v 34.219.51.216:8177  
     http://34.219.51.216:8177  

ii. INSTALL 'Deploy to container' Plugin on Jenkins UI
   This plugin allows you to deploy a war to a container after a successful build. , without pluggins we are unable to deploy to tomcat
   Plugins extends the functionality of jenkins for automation
   server address = http://34.219.51.216:8177 

1:09:26
iii. ADD A TOMCAT USER in /opt/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml 
   sudo vi /tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml                           ****** as ec2user an permitted to modify the file without sudo 
we can ll /opt/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-userxml to know who owns the file 
   <user username="myLandmark" password="admin123" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui,manager-script"/>
   <user username="landmark" password="admin123" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui,manager-script"/>


  **********  to check in tomcat server that the integration deployment was successful
tomcat public ip:8080/tesla  , our successful deployment in jenkins
shows: [var/lib/jenkins/workspace/javawebapp/target/teslar.war]

1:17
in our project repo, select src/main-webapp-jsps-homejsps

                                                     AUTOMATING BUILD IN JENKINS 
========================
How do you automate builds in Jenkins?   
======================================
Build Now:  is a limited measure of automation  

Automate builds using build triggers.
===================================== 
                         we can use a timer   1:33:17
1. build periodically = Timer [cronjob / crontab ] =   :    ******** Build periodically is triggered by the timer
     run this job every mid night [database backup]  
     run this job every 2am       [database backup] 
     run this job every minute = * * * * *                        ****** to build every minute 
     run this job every HOUR   = H * * * * 
        Do you really mean "every minute" when you say "* * * * *"? 
        Perhaps you meant "H * * * *" to poll once per hour

   Started by timer:
   Started by user landmartech33  
   Running as SYSTEM

   use cases for build periodically:
     database backup
     system Monitoring   
     system update   
     application performance Monitoring   (apm)


1:35:35
if u are doing software builds where developers are creating new version of the application, they are changing stuff constantly, we can configure pull SCM 

2. poll SCM - Timer + Changes in SCM via   :
  configure - triggers:pull SCM 
   In schedule :    *************************  apply and save
     * * * * * Every minute Jenkins will check for changes in the src to trigger a build  
     H * * * * Every hour Jenkins will check for changes in the src to trigger a build
  
use cases:
     Software builds 
     application build and Deployment
     Started by an SCM change
   

     Started by user: LandmarkTechnologies = BuildNow  
     Started by timer: build periodically 
     Changes in SCM  : pollSCM

when we configure pull SCM , a build will be triggered but this only happens if theres a new version of the application

******* so i have a job java base fintech project in jenkins and bc i hv configured pull SCM, every minute will make a REq IN GITHUB  searching for new version to do a 
a build  ( its all about versiong) if theres no new version , it doesnt do a build .    **** scm changes ie changes in SCM



                           New version
   SCM/Github     <---------------------------                  jnekins
repo/java based                                                  ci/cd
Src/unit test        -------------------------------------->    java base
pom.xml                                                          fintech
                                                                 project








1:45
3. GitHub-webhook :
   GitHub will notify Jenkins to trigger a build once there is a change in the scm [src]  

****** so in github, we will create a webhook, if thers any change inour application , software or code, github will notify jenkins so therfore no need for a timer 
if thers a new version of the applictaion , if developers commit new version 
we can also configure webhook for something else eg if we want to do code quality analysis with sonarcloud , we can configure github webhook so that if developers commit new
version of the applictaion, code quality analysis will be executed in sonarcloud and report will be created

1:48:00
we will know thers a new version bc of new commits or pushes, the webhook will be triggered
     
     Jenkins Server url = http://34.219.46.160:8080/
     GitHub-webhook     = http://34.219.46.160:8080/github-webhook/ 

    use cases for github webhook:      
     Software builds 
     application build and Deployment
     Started by GitHub push by legah2045 


under automation we can have 
4. Build other projects:  
eg
     1. cloneCode from SCM    triggers:
     2. RunUnitTesting   , triggers:
     3. CreateArtifacts  
     4. Run CodeQualityAnalysis  
     5. UploadArtifacts if 4 above is successful   
     6. deploy application to UAT environment     

2:00
5. Build after other projects:  
     Upstrean project  
       1. app-Test   
       2. app-Build+Release
       3. app-deployment-UAT/QA  
       4. app_deployment-Production   
       5. app_apm
       6. app-logMGT  
       7. app-discovery[webSevers/Services]    



       ****** 1:55:51
webhook doesnt work with sonarqube
webhook is the fastes of the triggers it happens in seconds, once thers a new version
