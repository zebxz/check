Explain your experience with Linux systems?
I have over 7 years experience perfoming various tasks on Linux systems including;
    FileMGT 
    userMGT 
    ProcessMGT
    securityMGT
    packageMGT
    serviceMGT 
    systemMGT 
    Monitoring 
    dbBackup  

1. Deploying, provisioning and creating Linux Servers in AWS Cloud.
   and connecting to servers using - ssh protocol  
       
2. Configuring, optimising, commissioning, decommissioning 
   and securing Linux servers

3. Running workloads in Linux servers/systems using:
  GUI  - CONSOLE  
  Commands - CLI  
  scripts  -  
  Examples of workloads/tasks executed:
    FileMGT /  = touch, vi, echo, ls, umask, chmod, mkdir, chown
    userMGT /  = adduser, usermod, userdel, chage, groupadd, groupdel, passwd  
    ProcessMGT = top, ps -ef, jobs, kill, bg, fg 
    securityMGT= passwd, selinux, firewall 

    packageMGT = wget, yum/apt, rpm,  

    serviceMGT = systemctl start/stop/enable/status serviceName  
                 systemctl start/stop/enable/status sshd/httpd/ntpd/chrond
                 service serviceName arguments
                 service sshd status/start/stop/disable

    systemMGT & Monitoring = df -h, free -m,    

4. scheduling and Automating tasks using cron tables 
   1. Backup all databases every midnight
   2. Deploy the latest version of the application every Sunday at midnight
   3. optimise our appServers every month on the 28th day  at midnight  
       yum update -y &&  yum upgrade -y    
   4. monitor system resources and send alerts using threshold every minute
       if cpu/mem usage exceed 80% send email df -h  = cpu 



Archive/Data Backup Commands:
zip :   Package and compress (archive) files  
unzip:  Extract compressed files in a ZIP archive.  
tar :   It is used to archive the directory/file

   tar -cfv  notes.txt  

tar = is used to :
  tar -cvf fileName fileName.tar.gz     = compress files  
  tar -cvf mynotes.tar.gz notes.txt  

  tar -xvf fileName fileName.tar.gz     = extract files  
  tar -xvf mynotes.tar.gz 

zip is used to:
  zip newFileName.zip fileName   
  zip notes33.zip notes    

Unzip filename.zip     - inflate/extract the original file

tee:  This command is used to store and view the
     the output of any other command.
     (both at the same time)     

echo "I am the finest Engineer"

[obi@demo33 ~]$ echo "Landmark Engineers are the best in 2023" > best
result ...send ..  landmark engineers are the best into the file without displaying 

BUT:
[obi@demo33 ~]$ echo "Landmark Engineers are the best in 2023" | tee best
Landmark Engineers are the best in 2023     .... (the input is stored and displayed at the same time)

[obi@demo33 ~]$ tail -5  /etc/passwd > newusers
[obi@demo33 ~]$

legah:x:1006:1006::/home/legah:/bin/bash
apache:x:48:48:Apache:/usr/share/httpd:/sbin/nologin
nginx:x:992:992:Nginx web server:/var/lib/nginx:/sbin/nologin


******** 
tail -5 /etc/passwd | tee new.txt  

result:
  it created the file new.txt and directs the tail info into it and displays the info as well


                                      PING

      This verify if the host is alive 
   ping localhost  = check if your local system is alive/running   
   ping landmark.cm  
   ping mylandmarktech.com                **** you are working for a coy and a cx calls and says the website is nt working, you can ping the website 
   ping google.com  

                                          TELNET
                      To check if a particular is running or not
telnet: 
for any computer or system;    a server/system/computer have 0-65535(65536) ports/addresses  
0-65535, ie port range
(65536 , ie no. of port or addresses

    ssh   = 22  
    http  = 80
    https = 443

 telnet 172.31.31.46 22 
  telnet 172.31.31.46 80  
   telnet 172.31.31.46 443

       telnet landmark.cm 80 
   telnet mylandmarktech.com 8080 
   telnet google.com 80    

history : Displays the recently executed commands .


STEP1: 
check for ip addresses = hostname -i
next 
telnet ip address portnumber

uname: describes your system  
   uname -a

                             tunlp
checks available addresses and addresses that are in use 

netstat -tunlp:
  a server/system/computer have 0-65535(65536) ports/addresses 
we have address:  server ports/address = 22/80/443/etc  
  tomcat requires to use port 8080 by default 
  sudo yum install tomcat  
  sudo systemctl start tomcat   

  nginx uses port 80 by default
    sudo yum install nginx  
    sudo systemctl start nginx   
  http server also uses port 80 by default 
    sudo yum install httpd  
    sudo systemctl start httpd   


**** therfore if port 8080 isnt available, tomcat wont install because it requires port 8080 by default for it to install
      
To insstall:  sudo yum -y install net-tools
netstat -tunlp
  t = tcp 
  u = udp  
  l = listening  
  p = port 
  n = number  : 

netstat -tulpn  


its important to know there are some ports to watch out for 

 protocols        ports/address    
   ssh              22  
   http             80  
   https            443  
   nfs              2089  
   rdp              3389  
   smtp          25/465/587         .....  (simple mail transfer protocol) 
   tomcat           8080 --- 8000  
   jenkins          8080      

****** THERFORE, for tomcat to run, we have to change the port address of one of them

TICKET 004:

John is unable to connect to the server. Please explain what could 
be the problem.
1. Check if John is running the ssh commands correctly
    ssh userName@ipaddress vs ssh ipaddress@userName 
    ssh 172.31.31.46@John  vs ssh John@172.31.31.46 

2. Check if the ssh-Port22 is open on the firewall/SG and 
   respond accordingly[]  
   inbound Rule: open port 22 for John to have access    

3. Check if the server is up and running 
     ping ipaddress/hostname/dns    

4. check if the ssh service(sshd) is running and react accordingly   
     systemctl status sshd 
     sudo systemctl status sshd
