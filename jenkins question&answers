Interview Questions on Jenkins
12:30 ###couldnt log back into jenkins on the browser so vi config.xml & change use security frm true to false then sudo systemctl retart jenksinand ls -l config.xml
to knw who owns the file

1. What is Jenkins executables?
  A Jenkins executor is one of the basic building blocks which allow a build to run on a node/agent/slave  (e.g. build server).
  ##for us to avoid a single point of failue, we configure jenkins master slave archi,& we realize when configuring a job in jenkins we hv the option of restrict whre dis
project can be built n in doing so we can choose any slave server, so jenkins wil nt be built frm d master, it wil build using a slave n d only reason that is achieved is
using the jenkins executables/executor

Think of an executor as a single “process ID”, 
  or as the basic unit of resource that Jenkins executes on an agent/slave/node to run a build.

#####5:56when we were doing a build in d slave, we we didnt instal maven, we only installed java in d slave btjenkins did a build in the slave server n that was 
possible due to jenkins executables


2. Explain the difference betweem freestyle and pipeline projects? .. tnk u so much in landmak we hv both freestyle n pipeline projects we use free mostly for our projects 
that hv to do with db backups, provisoning , monitoring of servers etc wheres all our projects dat relate to SW development dat relate to jenkins pullin the code frm github,
talking to maven to do a build , sonarqube for code quality we go via pipeline project 21:00

##21:52 with the help of a jenkins file we can define a node n decide that this node is stage1, so wit pipeline project its easy, bc der wil b a project wher u want mayb d 
build server to do the build, sonar for codequality so we can integrate all of this servers as slave servers in jenkins,& for each stage we decide d node dat particaular 
process wil run on, & dat is easily achieved using a pipeline project


freestyle option is the legacy build option dat jenkins hv been using, it the first option dat was avaialable when jenkins was first developed as a ci/cd tool& can be used
to build any project but a pipeline project Orchestrates long-running activities that can span multiple build agents. Suitable for building pipelines 
(formerly known as workflows) and/or organizing complex activities that do not easily fit in free-style job type.
pipeline  project is normally preffered for projects that can  is nt fit or can not be used for freestyle project
freestyle project is basically used for jenkins build& it the first option dat was initially used in jenkins to do a build ,it can even be used to run non SDLC builds (projects
e.g monitoring servers, database backup, provision servers etc, we can easily intergrate this with a freestyle project but for SDLC builds we run mvn package

PIPELINE: is used for complex projects
its also Iac= like to do a build i nid my jenkins pipeline script in a file called jenkins& evrytin i nid to do is defined in the file, so the imp of Iac cant be overemphasized
bc we can easily implement reusable code bc with the jenkins file i can easily modify it


3. Is it adviseable to deploy code from the feature branch in production? NO, bc we only deploy code frm master branch to prod, we can create a feature branch, /bugfix hotfix
 the recommendation wil be if our client wnt a part feature to be added to their appl, then our developers wil create new line/branch of dev frm d master branch.. 
so WHTAEVER is added,  developers wil develop, once they develop they create a pull(MERGE) rEQ 4 oda devlopers to review wot they hv done , if evertin is ok it shud 
be thoroughly tested b4 it is integrated into the master branch then from der we deploy to prod 

also its nt adviceable to deploy frm the bugfix branch 26;00

dev branch -- dev environment 
stage -- staging/UAT/ testing envr
master-- prod


4. Explain Jenkins intergration with GitHub?
it get to do wit authentication & authurization, jenkin nid to be auth in github using PW& username& by virtue of dat jenkins is now auth to clone codes from github
& for that to happen w hv to create cred where we authorize jenkins to communicate wit github ,& auth tk place in jenkins server using cred credentials can be 
token/username or generally PW & username  ..we go to our cred section of github& create our credentials such dat jenkins can easily get authenticated to 
pull code frm github .... bc gitcloning frm a privte repo we nid authentication & 90% ofd time we'l be 
cloning frm a private repo30:00 we can go to settings to change a project frm pulic to privat but may nt wrk if the repo has already being forked.
