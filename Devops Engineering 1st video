LSS (Landmark software solutions) approached by company telsa
to manage their application and develop a software

WAYS SUCH TASKS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE PAST 
1)Waterfall approach
2) Agile
3) Devops


##########################

LSS    *******   WATER FALL METHODOLOGY     (TELSA)
start by gtahering requirements - mr Telsa what do you want us to do for you? 

1)Requirements gathered by teamleads/Architect
high level documentation - system requirments
e.g what type of computers do you they need

2) desing - to design it - HLD/ SRS
3)Then development - the developers and software (sE ) ENGINEERS 
4)Testing - (QA) Qualty assurance
5) MAintenence stage - (support team) maake sure product is functioning aas expected , ensure product meets clients needs


LIMITATIONS
1) Poor time mgt: e.g project can be carrie dout in 4monthsbut if thers a problem, we have to carry out the entire process again
2)poor resource utilization: e.g when maintenance team is working other depts are idle , when testing is taking place developers are idle



#############################

AGILE METHODOLOGY : Scrum framework
we will have iterations/ sprints: repreents a dev cycle or unit
therfore we will hv diff sprint e.g sprint1, sprint2,  which will represent a dev cycle 
a sprint can last for 10 working days (10 WD)
what we will do in esch team will depend on our team composition/capacity

eg  sprint1 = 8 features              sprint2 = 6features
4 developers                               3 developers
2 QA                                        2 QA
3 scrum masters                              2 SCRUM masters
2 system administartion                      2 system administrators

ADVANTAGES
Agile approach is very good bc it makes use of meetings - sprint planing meeting , sprint restrospect, i5 mins daily standups. - before a sprint starts in the meetings tasks
will be assigned and evelautions regarging the outcome of the assignmets 
thers continous follow up to ensure our goals are achieved
restrospects : questions like what did we do well , what could be done better

LIMITATIONS
Team high velocity:  sprint 1 had 8 features but sprint2 could dev 6features bc of fewre team members

LSS          Devops end to end  Automation Methodology


Stage1 - Developing the Application
develpoers are to write source code, build script, unit test cases , project file
develpers are at diff locations/country 
developers submit the codes to source code (SCM) MGt tools eg of codes submitted are app javas, deploy java, pom xml

2)AUtomation  - jenkins pulls the code 
3) Maven - Creates  a build
4) code quality
5) upload artifactory (backup) incase something goes wrong with maven  server which can make deployment fail
6)Automation
7) deployment
8)APN



******** Our project is  a java project 
this is an end to end application , its developed using IAC and a good example is terraform which we can use to create this entire environment

The codes cannot be taken in its raw form to the clients env , it goes to the client in the form of of an application , so there will be an application running in tesla
the applications are deployeed in the form of app servers, ie that server sthat can run applications
eg tomcat
the raw codes (that are now in maven cannot go straight to tesla app servers), cant run/function in the app server , so it has to go through a convertion, a build(step3)
after the build process, it creates packages or arctifacts  (step 5)
eg jar/war/ear packages other companies may not use maven eg they can use ANT/CRADDLE , these are build tools but regardless, artifacts are created which are then taken to 
the coy(teslA)app server but before deplymentwe have to check for code quality  (step 4) ie how good are your written codes , therfore, it goes through a code quality 
analysis
the tool used for this process is call code quality  sonar qube /sonar cloud. until CQA is successful w ecant take package to cx

**************** This type of application that is been developed in this example is called Monolithic anchitecture Therfore, this application is developed using monolithic
Architecture
LSS alSO deVelops or now mostly micRo sevice appliCatioN and that helps them make use of containerisation technology
Where we use docker and kuberntes to deploy to Tomcat, but if we one us ansible we dont deply to tomcat.
