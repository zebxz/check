In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD










AWS COVERS 2 THINGS: .. so u can finish this course and work as any of this 
Cloud Engineering  
Infrastructure Engineering
so when we ar managing this resources thses ar all the infrat that nids to be managed:servers,
  - storage,  - databases, - networking,- software,- analytics, - and more
in managing infrastruture, we can :Infrastructure MGT [ create, view, update, delete, modify, grant access ] 
and dis can be done using GUI ... E.g chnaging the name of my server , vpc .. we ar managing dis frm the console n u realise when u do dis thers high possiblity of error
so apart frm using console we can use files 




****************************    SUMMARIZED FOR INTERVIEW*********************************


we use aws services based on the needs of the company ,coy wil use asw services based on task they ar trying to accomplish
For our cloud solution, we have diff cloud providers like  Cloud Service Providers - CSP = AWS / GCP / AZURE 
they Provide computing services / resources like servers, network, storage, security, etc. over the internet from their Datacenters 
  cloud computing is very imp and you can see a lot of COMPANIES ar migrating very quick &fast from on-prem to cloud to take advantage of cloud services
We have Cloud Service Models like :
=====================
IaaS -- Infrastructure as a service  : e.g ec2 instance  - ec2, SonarQube
PaaS--  Plat
the main cloud service providers :AWS - Amazon Web Services , GCP - Google Cloud platform), AZURE Cloud
The AWS Cloud spans with over 102 Availability Zones within 32 geographic regions around the world,
EXAMPLES OF AWS SERVICES includes
ec2 / eks elastic kubernetics serv / ecs elastic container services / iam, identity & access mgt / route53 / elb , AWS STORAGE SOLUTION like ebs elastic block storage, and using the root file system we can create mount point and attach 
block storage to our servers to expand/increase our storage size as required (from my command line i can type "list block command" where we hv our root file system.), also; we hv / efs ie elastic file storage,
/S3 bucket ie object storage,data can be stored in buckets
IF YOU CREATE FILES AND and store it in EFS/EBS, the files cannot just become accessible online  but with s3, i can store a file and its immediately accesible by anybody around the world. Also we have /SHARED Storage/ LAMBA FUNCTIONS/
DISASTER RECOVERY; of which we carried out a project as a diaster recovery measure , where we have our database servers running in account one but backedup in account 2 ( which is our diaster recovery 
account, so our database servers are backedup incase thers a disaster.
 So what we did is We created a snapshot lifecycle policy using Lambda  which creates sonapshots from our databases from account1 in account2
snapshot is a replica of your database, its a backup therefore if account1 is hacked, we already hv everything in account2 so we are able to recover from account2 
SO WIT THE HELP OF LAMBDA & snapshot lifecycle policy, this entire process was automated
so am proud of this project


AWS 8B
we hv application servers wher applications ar being deployed
18:49for traffic to be routed appriopriately, we v to do load balancing, it can be a load bal or ELS
WE require a software wich helps us achieve load balacing with relative ease e.g ngnix or h ah proxy
the LB does 2 tins , it either accepts or rejects the REQ.. .. 
*********meaning tht LB ARE impoertaNT BC IT ACTS As A security measure

if u are to xpalin cloud computing and ervytin dt is involved to it , wev bin able to realisee der ar certain elemrnts to that effet wich we can discuss wit relative ease when
cloud computing is involved...also talking abt cloud and their terms of org or levaraging their resources by a 3rd party ie using a 3rd party infrastructure and those 3rd parties
in computing languages we call dem  called cloud computing providers and dey can provide ntwrking sevrvices, database services,server services,compute serv... & dis ser ar imp
to tk note of when it comes to the diff element of cloud computing  our converstion v genral tailored towards that direction n all wev delibrated on is to ensure that end
to end exercise is been achieved seemlessly wit relative ease.
