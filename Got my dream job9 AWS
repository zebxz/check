LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat/ngnix tomcat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD










AWS COVERS 2 THINGS: .. so u can finish this course and work as any of this 
Cloud Engineering  
Infrastructure Engineering
so when we ar managing this resources thses ar all the infrat that nids to be managed:servers,
  - storage,  - databases, - networking,- software,- analytics, - and more
in managing infrastruture, we can :Infrastructure MGT [ create, view, update, delete, modify, grant access ] 
and dis can be done using GUI ... E.g chnaging the name of my server , vpc .. we ar managing dis frm the console n u realise when u do dis thers high possiblity of error
so apart frm using console we can use files 




****************************    SUMMARIZED FOR INTERVIEW********************************


in my env, AWS is our Cloud Service Provider we use aws services based on the needs of the company 
diff coy wil use asw services based on task they ar trying to accomplish
For our cloud solution which is Based on the need of our company , we thank advantage of the diff computing service/resources provided by AWS including; 
ec2 / eks elastic kubernetics serv / ecs elastic container services / IAM, identity & access mgt / route53 / elb , AWS STORAGE SOLUTION like ebs elastic block storage, and using the root file system we can create mount point and attach 
block storage to our servers to expand/increase our storage size as required (from my command line i can type "list block command" where we hv our root file system.), also; we hv / efs ie elastic file storage,
/S3 bucket ie object storage,data can be stored in buckets
IF YOU CREATE FILES AND and store it in EFS/EBS, the files cannot just become accessible online  but with s3, i can store a file and its immediately accesible by anybody around the world.
****ignore*** but s3 BUCKET CANT BE CREATED IN SUBNET (Because its a regional service, whose name must be globally unique.
Also we have /SHARED Storage/ LAMBA FUNCTIONS/
DISASTER RECOVERY; of which we carried out a project as a diaster recovery measure , where we have our database servers running in account one but backedup in account 2 ( which is our diaster recovery 
account, so our database servers are backedup incase thers a disaster.
 So what we did is We created a snapshot lifecycle policy using Lambda  which creates sonapshots from our databases from account1 in account2
snapshot is a replica of your database, its a backup therefore if account1 is hacked, we already hv everything in account2 so we are able to recover from account2 
SO WIT THE HELP OF LAMBDA & snapshot lifecycle policy, this entire process was automated
so am proud of this project
Also for our application servers wher applications ar been deployed  we v to do load balancing to we ensure that traffic is routed appriopriately, with ELB/NLB/ALB
WE require a software wich helps us achieve load balacing with relative like ngnix
LB is gud bc it does health check, security perimeter, accepts traffic or reject traffic & it spans accross an entire region cos with the help of route53, we can route to multiple regions & that means high availability is achieved.
Furthermore, security is inherent in our environment , WE DNT ALLOW DIRECT acces in our db server, if u wnt to acces it u v to go tru our 
jump sevrer. traffic goes to the jummpsever bc it has a security grp dat is permitting the trafic, it allows trafic on port22 so  in d
 SG 22 is open for members of the team & my vpc 10.0.0.0/24,i.e my ip. so my ip & port22 ar d two access  
the jumpserver acts as the entry point when it comes to ssh access,  frm d jump server u can access the app/ db servers,so any server in the vpc can be accessed
via the jump server
for more security, our vpc has some firewall ,2 types of firewall,
the 1st is the router for routing, wich permits traffic to be routed to the subnet bc if thers no route table permiting routing, the traffic wont happen
SO inside the vpc l create route tables, route table1 for the private subnet to support local traffic within my vpc, then route table2, i hv a public subnet 
wich is wher i place resources wich can be acessed externaly & wher i also created the NAT gateway to permit oneway internet traffic,therefore
the app server can access internet externally, & this is bc i decide that we can recieve traffic frm the internet but it can only happen frm the nAT gateway.
the route table2 is permitting traffic frm anywher(ie 0.0.0/0), both local& traffic frm the internet..
Also with the help of internet gateway, i can ensure comunication btw the servers by creating a route table, wich detr hw service is routed from one subnet to d oda
 inside our vpc.  it will allow internet to flow into the vpc & it wil allow exteral traffic so if we wnt to acess resourcs out of our vpc, out of our,
netwrk , we nid to hv internet , using IGW... Its all about modifying the route tables accordingly.
the 2nd firewall on our vpc is the one that stands infront of the subnet, like a gateman,called netwk acess control list nACL... 
in naCL, we can create some rule e.g open port80 for inbound rules &for outbound open port80 aswell, on my NACL, trafic frm enduser can get to my subnet.
for  trafic to get to the webserver ,in front of my webserver thers another layer of security ie security group (this is also a firewall)therfore i 
also have to open (port80 , 443 )in the webserver security grp
****** in  all we hv 2 security parameter
the 1st is the router for routing, wich permits traffic to be routed to the subnet bc if thers no route table permiting routing the traffic wont happen
the 2nd is the firewall wich has 2layers of security,, security at the subnet level & security at the server level
Finally, as an additional layer of security, we use the IAM = identity and access mgt, for authentication & authorization.
also we can grant & restrict permission based on the based on the role of each member, i can use IAM roles, these are policies/permissions that can be 
attcahed to another aws resource..[ec2 Instances, eks, ecs,etc.]  




************************** DNT PRINT

we use aws services based on the needs of the company ,coy wil use asw services based on task they ar trying to accomplish
For our cloud solution, we have diff cloud providers like  Cloud Service Providers - CSP = AWS / GCP / AZURE 
they Provide computing services / resources like servers, network, storage, security, etc. over the internet from their Datacenters 
  cloud computing is very imp and you can see a lot of COMPANIES ar migrating very quick &fast from on-prem to cloud to take advantage of cloud services
We have Cloud Service Models like :
=====================
IaaS -- Infrastructure as a service  : e.g ec2 instance  - ec2, SonarQube
PaaS--  Plat 
the main cloud service providers :AWS - Amazon Web Services , GCP - Google Cloud platform), AZURE Cloud
The AWS Cloud spans with over 102 Availability Zones within 32 geographic regions around the world,
EXAMPLES OF AWS SERVICES includes
ec2 / eks elastic kubernetics serv / ecs elastic container services / iam, identity & access mgt / route53 / elb , AWS STORAGE SOLUTION like ebs elastic block storage, and using the root file system we can create mount point and attach 
block storage to our servers to expand/increase our storage size as required (from my command line i can type "list block command" where we hv our root file system.), also; we hv / efs ie elastic file storage,
