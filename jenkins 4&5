2:23:35  JENKINS EXECUTORS ARE NOT PLUGINS, THEY ARE agents and parameters in jenkins that permit us to run jobs in the slave servers
we use plugins to establish connection btw jenkins and the slaves , for the slave to be added to the jenkins master, we need to use the ssh agent plugin



PROJECTS: 
  In LandmakTechnology I work in a Team where we:
1. Develop, test, build, secure, deploy, manage & monitor web and 
   enterprise applications for FinTech clients like;
      Banks  [ boa, wf, barclays, rbc, td, bicec, uba, ecobank ] 
      Insurance [BLI, WFG, TD, Sunlife, AIG  ] 
      Money Transfer [zelle, cashApp, interact, MTN-MOMO,
      payment gateways = VISA, MASTERCard, Paypal 

2. We automate the entire process stated above:by intergrating all the tools we hv been able to discuss
   PROJECTS Requirements:
    Git [git-bash]:
        IDEs = Integrated Development Environments
               simplifies the deployment process  
        vscode, pycharm, eclipes, atom 

PLUGINS MANAGEMENT: How to use plugins to achieve automation

Plugins Mgt in Jenkins 
==========================
 ---Plugins extends the functionality of jenkins, maven, etc.   

e.g, mvn package = this uses the following  
   mvn validate/
       compile/
       test/
       package/
       install/
       deploy/
       clean/
       sonar[plugin]:sonar[goal] 

Plugin Management
  how to install plugins in jenkins =    
  --> dashboard-->manageJenkins-->plugins and install
the common plugins we can find in our environment include the following among others 
  • Deploy to container to  [ deploy to tomcat ]
  • Deploy WebLogic
  • Maven Integration 
  • Safe Restart ************************************************1:13(to do)*
       This plugin allows you to restart Jenkins safely.,, it allows all the running jobs to be completed before restarting jenkins
but without it when u restrt jenkins while jobs are on going that can wreck some other processes, after its installation we can see it in our 
menu option.
we can install all these plugins depending on our task but we can also identify the plugin that will be commonly used and group them 
e.g for an agent slave to be configure the master/slave architecture, for the jenkins slave to be added to the maaster, we need an SSH plugin.
to import jenkins job from an old server to a new server e.g upgrading frm redhat 8 to redhat9
  • Next Build Number***************************
  • JACOCO********************************
  • SSH Agent
  • Email Extension
  • SonarQube Scanner
  • Audit Trail Plugin
  . job import plugin  
  • Schedule Build
  • Artifactory Plugin
  • Cloud Foundry
  • Build Name Setter*********************************
build name and description setter**************************
      1 / 2 / 3 / 11   
     we can reset it like this e.g tesla-1  tesla2, tesla17 
• Blue Ocean *************************************
2:27:00 audit trail: there will be diff individuals connecting to my server, doing diff task, to know that this task was done by emeka or john etc.we use an auditor

• Publish Over SSH:we can use it to send artifacts like whne a build server does a build , we can upload artifcats into nexus 
     jenkins --> ansible --deployment
     JENKINS-server    ------ appServer   
• ThinBackup : for backing up our jobs in jenkins incase smt goes wrong************************

• Convert To Pipeline*********************************************

• Job import plugin : to migrate jenkin jobs from one jenkin server to another ********************1:21 list of pluggins to install
  jenkins job migration 
    Jenkins server1 redhat6 
    Jenkins server2 redhat8  
    Jenkins server3 docker-container

IQ: Explain your experience using Jenkins in your Environment??? 
answers:
 1. I and my team have used Jenkins to automate tasks and run jobs/workloads:uing,
   ---  freestyle projects --- 5mins
   ---- maven projects     --- 2mins  
   ---- Pipeline projects  
   ---- multi-branch pipeline 
 2. With Jenkins i have managed projects such as:
    --- software/application builds and testing and deployment  
    --- systems  monitoring  
    --- application monitoring  
    --- database backup
    --- Infrastructure provisioning - when jenkins/terraform are integrated.. jenkins/terraformintegration 
    --- Infrastructure Configuration mgt - jenkins/ansible integration 
 3. I have installed, removed and updated plugins that extend Jenkins functionality:
   installed deploy to container
   update deploy to container 
   remove deploy to container
   Read The Release Notes [Documentation] for the Plugins 
   most Jenkins Plugins are developed by the Community  

 4. Using Jenkins Plugins to achieve automation:such as ,
  ssh, sshAgent, Publish-over-SSH, deploy to container, Slack notification,   
  job import, jacoco,
aside frm installing plugins, i hv also used plugins to achieve atomation and hv taken automation to the nxt level by 
configuring build triggers
 5. Configuring Build triggers such as:[pollSCM, webhooks] for automation:
i hv secured jenkins by ensuring :
 6. Configuring credentials for authentications:
     GitHub credentials 
     Tomcat-user 
     Docker-hub/Nexus/SonarQube/SONARCLOUD 
     username/temporal access /  

  7. Configuring Jenkins (master)slave agents  using ssh plugins:

there are problems in jenkins and i have been able to :
  8. Troubleshooting jenkins build related problems:
     -- permissions issues, Unauthorized [4** error codes] , i manage the credentials such taht jenkins can be authenicated by github or nexus accordingly
                     e.g jenkins trying to connect with nexus/sonarqube/github

     -- Jenkins [GitHub/sonarqube/nexus/tomcat] 

     -- Jenkins agent/slave failing to connect to the master
        [java not install], wrong java version, AUTHENTICATION

 9. Installation and configuration of the Jenkins server in Linux/Windows systems:  

 10. Securing the Jenkins server  :
   

IQ: What problems have you faced using/applying Jenkins in your Environment??
     1. builds failing
     2. jenkins service failing start so we need the complier, check if [java-11-openjdk] is installed
     3. slave/agent failing to connect to the master [bc of executables] mayb java is nt installed or trying to run multiple jobs at once
jenkins master slave architecture
to run multiple jobs at once,  we may have one jenkins master server connecting to to other jenkins slaves via executioners
      4. integration isues, integration failing
     3. firewall issues = ports [8080 / 8899] not open      

JENKINS MASTER -SLAVE ARCHITECTURE:
====================================
1:38 we can connect multiple slave servers to one jenkins master so that we can run multiple jobs at once

JENKINS MASTER SLAVE ARCHITECTURE CONFIGURATION
   For a slave or an agent to be connected to the jenkins master :
     1. java-11-openjdk must be installed in the slave/agent ( in the CLI) 
1:56 sudo yum install java-11 -y  
java --version

2. use sshAgent plugin to establish the connection    

     ip = 3.95.244.231   PUBLIC
          172.31.81.224  PRIVATE 
1:44:45 iF THEY ARE IN THE SAME NTWRK I USE PRIVATE IP, IF THEY ARE IN DIFF NTWRK I USE PUBLIC IP
    ssh -i demo32.pem  ec2-user@172.31.81.224 
    ssh -i demo32.pem  ec2-user@3.95.244.231  
1:46 TO MAKE the CLI a slave, in jenkins server; 
FOR now when we click on manage jenkins --nodes and cloud , we hv jst the master server, we click on its blue settings or built in node
no. of executors:2  - label :master then save
 we can configure the master and add slaves by clicking on 
-add new node- name: agent1 -select permanent agent- excutors: 1 0r 2 etc -remote root dir: /home/obi- lebel:maven
1:50 launch method:launch agents via ssh - host is my ipadress - credential: add (jenkins)..(in CLI, we ls/home to see users and sudo passwd obi to assign passwd:admin123)
credential ,add; kind: username with paswd - username:obi ,-passwd: admin123 - description and ID :obilogin - 
credentials: obi - hostkey: manually trusted key and save - relaunch agent
remote root dir:/home/ec2-user or /home/ubuntu
then the kind option is with prvate key:search for private key file in download folder ,copy n paste and add
# disk space is too low means it has a resource issue ... and we can add space by increasing the linux box



   ssh -i "demo32.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-95-244-231.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    yum install java-11 -y


   ssh -i "demo31.pem" ubuntu@ec2-52-87-183-168.compute-1.amazonaws.com
   ssh -i "demo31.pem" ubuntu@52.87.183.168  

      sudo apt update  
      sudo apt install default-jre
      java -version


TO USE ANY OF THE AGENTS      ..e.g to run a project on agent3
Click on the project - configure- restrict wher this project can be run: agent 3  - save
to build click build with parameters
when we build we can see the angent 3 reflected in the output for no.8 but output n0.7 was done without any restriction it was built straight from the master
7:
09:18:26 Started by user mylandmarktech32
09:18:26 Running as SYSTEM
09:18:26 Building in workspace /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/landmark-webapp

8: even though maven was uninstalled in the CLI of the agent server, it was able to build with executors
10:53:45 Started by user mylandmarktech32
10:53:45 Running as SYSTEM
10:53:45 Building remotely on agent3 (docker) in workspace /home/ubuntu/workspace/landmark-webapp

therefore we can hv multiple jobs runing at once (very fast) which will increase efficiency n performance, one job running for 
python-webapp running in
   agent1   
another job running in 
maven-webapp 
   agent3   
and another running in 
nodeJS webapp
   agent2      

with the help of Jenkins executors, jenkins run jobs in slaves/agents
even though maven was uninstalled in the CLI of the agent server, it was able to build no.8 with executors 

2:23:35  JENKINS EXECUTORS ARE NOT PLUGINS, THEY ARE agents and parameters in jenkins that permit us to run jobs in the slave servers
we use plugins to establish connection btw jenkins and the slaves , for the slave to be added to the jenkins master, we need to use the ssh agent plugin

QUESTIONS:
why do DEvelopers need git in their environment since git will be installed in jenkins?
developers are to develp the application and use git for versioning the application, 
when they do a git commit, they creat a new version
and to share the code they need the git push command and as a devops engr, we need git to clone the code.
we no longer need maven standalone bc in jenkins we can install maven as a tool
if we want to run a job in jenkins we can jenkins master slave architeture without havin to install maven in the set slave server, so long as i hv 
the tool maven installed and running in jenkins and with the help of jenkins executors, jenkins will run the jobs with relative ease.

is the low system/resource requirement/capacity of agent that were established a problem?.. e.g some are free tier servers
bc our jenkins reqire a minimum of 4GB ram 
not necessary, as a matter of fact , this is the first time an agent has failed on the grouns that it doesnt hv enough resources, but thi scan abe added as one of the problems
encountered for TS using jenkins and hw did you solve them 

ADVANTQAGES OF SLAVE MASTER ARCHITECTURE
it helps in redundancy e.g if the job in the master fails, we stil hv the jobs in the slaves
it enhances the master performance
it helps with para builds,i.e running multiple jobs at once, inorder words, one job doesnt hv to run and end b4 another starts.. bc under normal circumstances, 
when running multiple jobs in jenkins, depending on the number of executioners,one job wil run and end b4 another starts but master/slave makes multiple jobs possible.
