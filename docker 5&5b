FROM python:3.7
WORKDIR /opt/app
COPY .  .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements-prod.txt
EXPOSE 5000

pwd gave us /home/ubuntu/pfa (we renamed the repository file we cloned to  pfa)
so thta means we ar in home/ubuntu/pfa
COPY . . means to copy every tin frm my pwd of my home server to the pwd of my image am creating
 is similar to mvn package wher d artifcars ar been created, bc this is a python application so when creatingb the image it runs this for us:

==============
  Deploy a nodeJS web application using docker: 
    1. use/Create/modify the Dockerfile   
    2. Use the Dockerfile to build a docker image  
    3. Push the image to an image registry[dockerhub/ecr/nexus/JFrog]
    4. pull, inspect and scan the docker image
    5. deploy applications using the image  
GithubRepo    =  https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/nodejs-application
dockerhubRepo =  mylandmarktech/nodejs-fe-app
                 docker push mylandmarktech/nodejs-fe-app:tagname

9:20 we v  a github and dockerhub repo for this project ?? does it mean we can use any of the repo ?????? 

we wnt to containerize the appli, n with the help of the docker file we ar able to 

clone the github repo , its a private repo n we cloned successfully
ls
cd nodejs-application/
ls , n we can see d docker file
cat docke file
docker ps , to check for containers 
     i wn to build a node image
1) docker build -t nodeapp:1 .   , to build a docker image ........   ( nodeapp:1  ,ie   version 1)

docker tag nodeapp:1 mylandmarktech/nodejs-fe-app:33    ,,, tagging successful
2)docker push nodeapp:1 mylandmarktech/nodejs-fe-app:33
error pushing so we authenticate
docker login -u mylandmarktech
#### 23:16 even after authentiacting we couldnt push to the private repo bc he nids to upgrade his account,its a subscription issue , so we used anoda public repo
so we created tag for our image for a diff public repo in github
docker tag nodeapp:1 mylandmarktech/nodejs-app:2, to mk it distributable
docker push nodeapp:1 mylandmarktech/nodejs-app:2    ... image name: push nodeapp:1    ,, container name and tag: nodejs-app:2
#### we deleted all d images
so this:nodeapp:1 is no longer in our local servrer bt we hv shared it in our register when we created the tag above bt we didnt push it

## 24:18 in the ticket above we v a keyword EXPOSE 9981 , its our container port  for port forwarding, so to deploy the application:
 
docker run --name nodeapp -d -p 7777:9981 nodeapp:1
bt this : nodeapp:1 is nolonger in our local servrer bt we v shared it in our register when we created d tag above bt we didnt push it, so we dnt v nodeapp:1 anywhere



docker ps -q to list containers id
to stop the containers:   docker stop container ids
to remove stopped container : docker rm container ids

5)docker run --name nodeapp -d -p 7777:9981 nodeapp:1
###### bt this : nodeapp:1 is nolonger in our local servrer bt we hv shared it in our register when we created the tag above bt we didnt push it
so we v to use the image that is found in my registry the version2
docker run --name nodeapp -d -p 7777:9981 nodeapp:2  ,, i dnt hv hv nodeapp:2 in my local server bt i have it in my registry, in my image remote registry
29:58 so when i execute docker run,this will pull/use the image to create n start the container


36:24 ## 24:18 in the ticket above we v a keyword EXPOSE 9981 , its our container port  for port forwarding,so frm my docker engine, its forwarding the port to this
container, the port is forwarded internally b172.170.2:9981
host port changes but port address :container port doesnt




###### USE "netstat" TO KNW WHAT PORT NUMBER TO USE AS THE HOST PORT 
      
to check the ports in use, we can run netstat -tulpn , n i can see the all the ports in use
to install netstat : sudo apt install net-tools
A servers has 2^16=65536 ports/addresses [0,1,2,3...,65635]
    nodeapp   =  7777 ,, WE delete this container n 
    nodeapp2  =  7777   deployed this on 7077

    netstat -tulpn 



                                        API
*** api/restfull api are http get request
eg when u type bank of america/login (boa/login), you are requesting & getting some login information
also we hv  diff get request. so  when developers develop the appl, its developed such that users are able to access diff restful APIs, 
51.32 so it could be a request for login, it could be an http post request like edit/modify request eg delete account details
it is post bc you were able to provide the login info & now you logged in.
so developers are developing the appl such that you can perform diff task so they create restful API
so you can get login information, account details, modify information etc 

***ONLINE*** An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software programs to communicate and
exchange data with each other. Think of it as a standardized "menu" that defines how one application can access the functions and data of another, 
enabling developers to integrate existing services into their applications rather than building everything from scratch. This process uses a request-response
model, where one application sends a request to the API, which then processes it and returns the data or functionality requested.  

RESTful APIs, also known as REST APIs,
are a specific type of Application Programming Interface (API) that adheres to the architectural style of Representational State Transfer (REST). 
This style defines a set of constraints and principles for designing networked applications, particularly web services.
Key characteristics of RESTful APIs:
Client-Server Architecture: There's a clear separation between the client (e.g., a web browser, mobile app) and the server (where the data and logic reside). 
They can evolve independently.
Statelessness: Each request from the client to the server contains all the necessary information to understand the request. The server does not store any 
client context between requests.


45:00     RESTFUL API's
to acccess the restful APIs,  we go to the application file in github , w can see a file called app.js
in it there are some restful APIs 
these are some get req ie when developers develop the appl, its developed such that users are able to access diff restful APIs, 
eg http get request

RestFulAPIs .. ........ 52.08 ... this ARE jst get inf wher u can get some json details, account login etc
 ===========
   app.get('/landmarktechnologies

   httpPostRequests:..  also http post req bc u can edith info 
      https://boa.com/edit 
        delete account details  
        modify details 
         password= 
#####so developers ar developing the appl such that u can perform diff tasks, so dey create some restful APIs

Bank of America  : ....these ar all inf for users to access it

about pausing the process   
i can pause to TS
if u deploy an appli n its running , n now thers an info u wnt to update on the container
so u can pause the container process so that users cant access it until u v fixed it
### WE pause and hv to unpause when we are done updating


                                      RESOLVING ISSUES
#######How to resolves issues occuring in a docker container??
first run :
1. docker ps -a 
     This will check if the container is running, paused or stopped/exited
     if stopped you should restart to resolve the issue  ,, bc we cant access the container if its nt running
     if paused you should unpause to resolve the issue  
     docker unpause; docker start 

docker inspect  ... "will show us network ie is the container in a ntwrk" does it v ip adress, a container thats running we shud see the ip address in networks
and we can see the state as shown below that the container is nt running based on my inspeection, so we can start d container to solve the problem bc d container is exited
e.g
***  most of the time when we look at networking after we kill a container n start a container, we ll see the ipadresss will change
2. docker inspect containerNAME/or ID                  host:containerPort
   docker run --name nodeapp1 -d -p 7000:9000 mylandmarktech/nodejs-app:2  ,,,container port is suppose to be 9981 thats why we ar unable to access the contAiner bc when it
   forwards d trafic to port 9000 the application does nt listen on port9000 in d container
      *** 1.17.15*** so when we run container inspect, we can see the right container port number,so we can compare if its d ryt port we were suppose to use 
   3.22.217.29:7000/landmarktechnologies 
   "State": {
            "Status": "running", ,, although we can see d container is running, we cant access d conatiner bc it has an problem called out of memory, if ders no memory d  
            "Running": true,                                         container can be killed
            "Paused": false,
            "Restarting": false,

            "Dead": false,                                                                           if thers no memory the container could be killed.
            "Pid": 54586,   ,, the process id of the container running
            "ExitCode": 0,
            "Error": "",
 e.g we access   webserver=80/443
ssh=22/32  

3. docker logs containerNAME/ or ID  
  ubuntu@docker:~$ docker logs nodeapp1
  Node JS app is running at http://localhost:9981/landmarktechnologies
  ubuntu@docker:~$
  Node JS app is running at http://localhost:9981/landmarktechnologies
  Node JS app is running at http://localhost:9981/landmarktechnologies

4. docker top containerNAME/ID = check resources/processes, to check the process running inside a container 
          How processes are running.     1.21.00*** a container can be killed bc of resources issues

1.22.12    we can also check the statistics
5. docker stats containerNAME/ID = = check resources 
      "OOMKilled": false,  (out of memeory)



                                         TROUBLESHOOTING CONTAINERS USING INTERACTIVE OR DETACHABLE MODE **mee**

****online *** docker exec provides an option to run commands in a running container either in detached mode by using the -d option or in interactive
mode by using the -it flag
           i think *** docker exec app pwd***  i think this is in detachable mode
             WHILE 
             ***docker exec -it webapp bash*** is interactive mode



 1.25.00            DETACHABE MODE
6. docker exec  = run commands inside the container , to troubleshoot a container we can run commands inside the container
  docker exec , the container name /iD and the command u wnt to execute
  now let me deploy 2 containers
 docker run --name app -d -p 6000:8080 mylandmarktech/java-web-app 
   docker run --name webapp -d -p 8080:8080 mylandmarktech/maven-web-app 
 
DockeR logs container name/id to Check if ders a problem
docker exec  = run commands inside the container 
e.g docker exec webapp ls logs         *** ie the command i want to run is ls logs , i want to list the logs to check the log files.
e.g docker exec app pwd           ***  the comand i wnat to run is pwd


                            
                         TROUBLESHOOTING ISSUES IN INTERACTIVE MODE
  1.27.50      
7. access in interactive mode ,, ie to interact with the container
    docker exec -it containerNAME/ID bash

                                    ****online,
                         No, the docker cp command does not directly support copying files between two containers.
                       You cannot use a command like docker cp container1:/path/to/file container2:/path/to/destination.
                          To transfer a file from one container to another using docker cp, you must perform a two-step process:


1.46.00
docker cp = copy files from a container and to a container
  ***online**  The docker cp command facilitates copying files and directories between a Docker container and the local filesystem of the Docker host. 
This command is useful for transferring data, configuration files, or logs without needing to restart or rebuild containers. 


    A)  copy from a container ; docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp
                                 ***online
                             docker cp my_container:/app/source_directory/container_file.log ./local_destination/
                                       
    B) Copy to a/(same) container ;  docker cp home.jsp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/
                                    ** online
                             Copying a file from the host to a container:
    docker cp ./local_file.txt my_container:/app/destination_directory/



1)##########copy from a container:      (TO MY HOME/HOST SERVER)
(as seen above 1.29.19) inside our container we hv this 'webapps dir' tomcat deployment dir & inside the dir we hv a home.jsp file thats inside d tesla aplication.
meeee*** we want to copy the 'home.jsp' file into our home/host server
the relative path to the file is; /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp, but to copy the file we cant use the relative path, it wil say file nt found
a))therefore we have to first use the absolute path to the file & first copy the webapps dir where we hv the file ;  /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
so we run: docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps ; this means we wnt to copy the 'webapps' tomcat deployment dir, thats where we hv the jsp file 
b)then we can use the absolute path to copy the jsp file:  webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp


start;
ubuntu@docker;~ docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp .  
*********** didnt work***  bc am using the relative path to the file we are trying to copy
docker exec webapp ls
lib conf logs temps  webapps       *** inside webapps we hv tesla, jsp & home.jsp
so lets use the absolute path
docker exec webapp pwd 
/usr/local/tomcat              *** this is the absolute path to the file

a)therefore we first run;
ubuntu@docker;~ docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps
copy successful
ls 
node js application,  pfa, web, webapps          *****meee***  inside webapps conatiner we hv tesla app,  & inside tesla we hv jsp & home.jsp file
****** 1.14.15.   earlier we were not able to copy bc we were using the relative path

b)then we run; 
docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp 
successful
ls
node js application,  pfa, web, webapps, home.jsp   
                    ****SUCCESSFULLY copied to my home server
vi home.jsp
then he edited it and when we checked the application on the browswer, but we cant see the editing/changes he did inside the 'jsp file
   that means the changes is not yet part of the container 

( The above illustrated that we copied from the webapps tomcat deployment dir which is in our webapp container to our home/host server, we could not see the change
done in the home.jsp file on the browser yet bc we hvae not copied the change into the container but once we copy d change into the container we will see the change
(when am practising, ill see if i can directly vi into the webapp container then vi into the home.jsp file, mk the changes & see if it shows on the browser.)


1.43.50  docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp  ** i copied this file frm my container to my host server
                     now i want to copy this file 'home.jsp' its in my home server, **i bliv bc its in my host server its also in my home server.
                     therefore we can now copy frm our home server to the webapp container.



2)COPY FROM HOME SERVER TO A CONTAINER ****meee***
          ******** to make the changes part of the container 

1.44.51
docker cp home.jsp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/
now we are copying the file'hom.jsp' into the webapps path we copied earlier our container called webapp; 'webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/'
copy was sucessful
**** now when we access the application on the browser we see the changes he did when he vi into the jsp file 
1.45.20  having done this modification, what can i enforce, to ensure that these changes are captured in my image 
because my original image i pulled from dockerhub does not have the changes yet.

  we use docker commit...


********** 1:46:23      docker run --name webapp -d -p 8080:8080 mylandmarktech/maven-web-app 
but the image i pulled in no.6 above doesnt v this change that was done when i vi home/jsp
so i v to run docker commit ie create a  new image


*************************** docker 5&6********
when the process in a container is running der ar obviously some changes
when u deploy a container, der wil b some changes btw the container n the image wich was used to create the cointainer e.g we v copied some files into the container

**** TO KNOW THE CHANGES THAT V OCCURED IN THE CONTAINER
docker diff container name/id
its the diff btw the image used to create the container n the changes tahe v occurred in the container
 
###### to maintain the changes in future application , we can commiit the changes
docker commit 
enables us to extract an image frm a running container
*********************************************************************

                                             DOCKER COMMIT
******What is docker commit?
Using docker commit we can create image from a continer.
docker commit <containerId/Name> <imageName>
docker commit webapp newimage:1 

***** docker commit webapp mylandmarktech/maven-web-app:class34  
then when i run docker image, i can see the new image with tag class34
**** then push to my docker hub account so members of my team can understand/see the change
docker push mylandmarktech/maven-web-app:class34  ,, now if u go to my docker repo u wil find this image 
**** create a container wit the imge 
docker run -d --name app -p 8088:8080 mylandmarktech/maven-web-app
when i check in my browser with the publici:8088
i can see the new change
i wasnt asked to authenticate bc i am already authenticated the first time n the token is already saved in my server
the first time u try to push, it will ask you for authentication bt subsequently it wil use the token u v used before


***** didnt use these commands****
docker diff contianerName/ID   
docker commit app image2

1.51.50 IQ                       CONTAINER CPU
Can we set CPU,RAM limit for the containers while creating?
Yes We set using options while creating a container
so while creating your container we can decide how much cpu the container will contain.



docker container commands:
docker kill wil stop the container without any waring, while docker stop will give u a warning
  docker run/create/start/stop/kill/inspect/logs/top/stats/
  docker diff/update/cp/commit/pause/unpause/ps/ps-a/exec
  docker rm/rm-f/ps -q/   

docker images commands:
  docker build/login/push/pull/tag/images/images prune/  
  docker rmi/rmi -f/system prune 

docker images --help   
docker containers --help

    DOCKER FILES, DIFF APPLICATIONS & THEIR BASE IMAGE, DIFF APPLICATIONS & THEIR BASE IMAGE, CONTAINER KILLED BY ADMIN OR A PROCESS


QUESTION
How do you know the container port number for a certain image and frm a tomcat server hw do u create the images and place them in a docker file 
3:41 PROF: when u go thru the docker file video for tomcat, every u asked will be auto answered
BUT WHEN WE go to the project file in github, we can see the port number .... e,g in this docker file the KEYWORD Expose is used to  indicate the container port number
that the application is listening on


Dockerfiles:
============ 
FROM  base image containing dependencies & Softwares  
  the applications will hv diff base images



***********************************
APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT   ***tomcat1&2**
which kind of projects are we managing?
we are managing java based projects - projects that are developed in the java lanaguage
*****mee***  jboss/wildfly supports/used for enterprise application while tomcat supports jar/standalone & war/web applications
**************************************



                          DIFF APPLICATIONS & THEIR BASE IMAGE, CONTAINER KILLED BY ADMIN OR A PROCESS

if am working in a python application, IF U WNT TO DETRT the base image for a python application , u will nid python so the base image shud be frm python
python web applications 
  FROM python3.7    

OR nodejs application, 
nodejs application , it needs
  FROM node11  

OR .NET application
.net application    
          

 JAVA BASE APPLCATION 

or,  java base aplication will need image from either tomcat or jboss
java web application, will need
  FROM tomcat:8.0.20-jre8  ,, tomcat 9
  EXPOSE 8080  ,, tomcat is expose on port 8080
  
or FROM jboss/wildfly:latest  ,, if i dnt pass the tag, the tag by default wil b latest
  EXPOSE 8080    ,, jboss is expose on port 8080

java Enterprise application , can only be used with jboss image
  FROM jboss/wildfly:latest 
  EXPOSE 8080  

OR
java standalone application , this needs image frm 
  FROM openjdk11      

***** if ur deployin a java stanalone application, it needs java to run 

  
###### what can make an image be in a pause state??
when u create an image and push to dockerhub n in that state the image is nt running, so u nid to pull the image, create and start d container b4 the application is running
and all of that can happen with docker run
docker run = pull/create/start   


                       CONTAINER KILLED BY ADMIN OR A PROCESS
to stop the container u can execute 
   docker kill/stop  
and once the containeer is stopped, you can start the container
BUT DOCKER Stop is recommemnded bc it will give a warning b4 stopping whie docker kill doesnt give a warning

but the container can be killed by the admin by running docker kill or by a process
docker kill/stop  = admin / process 
OR by the docker process bc it is out of memory :OOMKilled  
due to insufficent memory to support the container n it has kiled the container
this can be resolved by adding memory to the docker host 
e.g in aws u can jst change the instance type
e.g u had 
the container can be 
    t2-micro  =  running with 1GB  
  so u can change to   T2-MEDIUM = 4GB  

u can also alocate memmory and cpu to containers

##### about pausing the process   
i can pause to TS
if u deploy an appli n its running , n now thers an info u wnt to update on the container
so u can pause the container process so that users cant access it until u v fixed it
### WE pause and hv to unpause when we are done updating

jenkins file is written in grovy language
terraform is written in hcl
what language is docker file written in very simple language almost like a bash shell script,, its a very simple file
go language is used to write docker file


QUESTION
with regards to out of memory issues, is der a way we can use autoscaling 
EVEN THOUGH WE Spoke abt out of memory, it rarely happens bc containeriztion itself has a lot of options that we ;ll look at when we get to kubertnets
### ull cm to realise that docker basically is going to ends with docker files
the rest we ar going to be using docker to create images, push the images and then use kubernetes to deploy the application
**** when it comes to deployment,we wont use docker to deploy bc docker cannot scale 
e.g u cant decide to deploy 10 replicas of webapp with docker but with kubernetes u can deploy as many replica as u want
bc docker cannot scale, it can only deploy one replica of an appliaction and that is a problem
