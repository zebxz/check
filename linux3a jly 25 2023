sudo is a command that permits adin to run commands as another user  
to change to root user - sudo -i 
then you can adduser  eg adduser paul 
but as ec2user (or any other user) you do : sudo adduser paul

  * i think someone asked about recovering files like in recycle bin for windows


[root@demo~] # exit
logout
[ec2-user@demo~] $ 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ who am i
ec2-user
[ec2-user@demo~] $ 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo -i
[root@demo~] #
[root@demo~] # exit
logout 
[ec2-user@demo~] $
[ec2-user@demo~] $ adduser paul
permisson denied
aduser cannot lock/etc/passwd, try again later
[ec2-user@demo~] #
[ec2-user@demo~] # sudo -i
[root@demo~] #
[root@demo~] # aduser paul
[root@demo~] #
[root@demo~] # who am i
root
[root@demo~] # ls/home
