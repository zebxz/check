FILE RELATED COMMANDS, CONNECTING TO SERVER AS ROOT USER, 

sudo is a command that permits adin to run commands as another user  
to change to root user - sudo -i 
then you can adduser  eg adduser paul 
but as ec2user (or any other user) you do : sudo adduser paul

  * i think someone asked about recovering files like in recycle bin for windows


[root@demo~] # exit
logout
[ec2-user@demo~] $ 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ who am i
ec2-user
[ec2-user@demo~] $ 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo -i
[root@demo~] #
[root@demo~] # exit
logout 
[ec2-user@demo~] $
[ec2-user@demo~] $ adduser paul
permisson denied
aduser cannot lock/etc/passwd, try again later
[ec2-user@demo~] #
[ec2-user@demo~] # sudo -i
[root@demo~] #
[root@demo~] # aduser paul
[root@demo~] #
[root@demo~] # who am i

[root@demo~] # ls/home

 FILE RELATED COMMANDS
ii)file related maintenance commands    (commands for managing files)
touch  fiename = creates an empty file 
cat filename = read the file content 
echo = print results of command   ( prints the output content of what is typed
echo  (>) to redirect output into a file & replace the file content
echo (>>) to append output into a file and add to the content
ec2-user@demo~ ] $ echo ' i am a rich ' > devops
the output is redirected into an existing file or a newly created file and replaces the file content
***** can echo create files = YES in this case  (devops ) was created

Adding content to file with echo: the output is appended (>>) into a file and add to the content
eg ec2-user@demo~ ] $ echo 'with landmark' >> devops 
ec2-user@demo~ ] $ cat devops       ie read devops file 
i am rich
with landmark

to connect to my system, i need to connect to my server, & to connect, i need an AWS account then i can connect as a root user or an IAM user
 
****13:50
CONNECTING TO MY SERVER AS IAM USER
Aws IAM username :
Aws Account no/id: 287784533479
password
     OR 
root user email 
password

CONNECTING AS ROOT USER and using the key is more secured
servers public ip address:
authenticated username:
password :
OR 
private-SSH_KEY: key33.pem    *** USING THE KEY IS MORE secured
ssh-client: eg mobaxterm, PUTTY,gitbash ( depending on what your company is using

15;00
it is more secured to connect as an IAM user bc as a root user u hv authority to do anything& if someone acess your account it can be dangerous
