****** we hv a client tesla, lets create a dir for telsa

[root@demo~] # exit
logout
[ec2-user@demo~] $ 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ who am i
ec2-user
[ec2-user@demo~] $ 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ sudo -i
[root@demo~] #
[root@demo~] # exit
logout 
[ec2-user@demo~] $
[ec2-user@demo~] $ adduser paul
permisson denied
aduser cannot lock/etc/passwd, try again later
[ec2-user@demo~] #
[ec2-user@demo~] # sudo -i
[root@demo~] #
[root@demo~] # aduser paul
[root@demo~] #
[root@demo~] # who am i
root
[root@demo~] # ls/home
domi ec2-user obi paul



             DIRECTORY MGT COMMANDS
mkdir = create a directory or directories
rmdir = delete an empty dir
rm -rf = delete my dir
cd =  directory navigation
pwd = present working dir
ls = list of the dir content
tree = show me both parent and child dir


TICKET001:
Create work directories for telsa client
[ec2-user@demo~] $  mkdir tesla

to check if the directory was created 
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls
telsa (test.txt)       , our proof


                                  TO CREATE HIDDEN FILES
mkdir.filename


******** ********
ctrl C = to kill a process
exit = logout/exit rootuser
exit = logout a session




TICKET002:      create directory (mkdir)
create project 01  directory using the format below 
dev/git/maven/aws        nexus/java

it means that we want to create a dir called dev, inside dev there will be git, inside ther will be maven, inside amven aws nexus

the command to use is  = mkdir -p  dev/git/maven/aws
we can also  = mkdir -p-v dev/git/maven/aws
   OR -pv
-p = create including the parent directory 
-v = create in verbose mode (its a system informing what has happened

eg mkdir -v class33
[ec2-user@demo~] $ 
[ec2-user@demo~] $  mkdir -v class33
mkdir; created directory class33



[ec2-user@demo~] $ mkdir -pv  dev/git/maven/aws
mkdir: created directory 'dev' ie directory dev created 
mkdir: created directory 'dev/git' ie directory git which is inside dev created
mkdir: created directory 'dev/git/maven ie directory maven which is inside git and dev created
mkdir : created directory  'dev/git/maven/aws


******** with commands automation is very possible 



     HOW TO RUN TASK IN LINUX SYSTEMS
-GUI/console 
- CLI = commands with some automation
- script with more automation


TO CONFIRM THE DIREECTORIES WERE FORMED
[ec2-user@demo~] $  Ls dev
git
[ec2-user@demo~] $ ls dev/git
maven


************* cd = to navigate the user home directory 
cd.. = to navigate one directory backward
cd../../../../ = navigate 4 directories backward


       TO INSTALL A COMMAND NOT FOUND

su -root - switch user to root ( it requests for root user password )
sudo -i switch user to root without password
sudo -u-
switch user to paul : su - paul
[root@demo~] # su - ec2-user


******** to install tree using root command/priviledges
sudo yum install tree 
OR
sudo -u root yum install tree


















                                 COMMANDS TO DELETE DIRECTORIES
