containerization, docker ... virtualization  ... read powerpoint script

to deploy application, we nid systems to mange the deployment, so either i geta  physical system, it comes wit harddrive/RAM, then on this physical/hardware system we
install operating sys in the software componant,  e.g of Op system :windowns, linux,,, for the instalation we nid we ill nid some storage like database wher we ll hv all dis
  inatalled and the storage wil  be captured in the harddrive.. on the storage we v our application running and on the op sys we ar able to deploy our application
  the op comes with the bin dir wher d commands ar found,opt,sbin etc dir bt what is very imp is the bin dir.. on the op sys we v our application deployed n running like 
  dbase appl etc n this is called traditional deployment of application and with dis traditional approach we ar heavily depending on a physical sys, physical sys ar used
  from dis we move to virtualization
  
  7:59 VIRTUALIZED DEPLOYMENT  ... XEN IS an hypervisosr e.g is EC2 INSTANCE VM 
ON THE PHYSICALsys we already hv, we ar able to create a virtual sys and we ll nid a hypervisor, on the op we install the hpervisor e.g virtual box,hyperV/xen/vmware 
  this are sofwares that can permit to host a virtual sys on a phy sys like laptop, servers, or even in the cloud
  e.g of a physical sys is the laptop wit any of the op sys running on it ,, then we instal a guest op sys, we wnt to deploy our appl so we create virtual machines on d 
    phy sys .. e.g on our laptop the  windows op sys is the host oS  ,, on th host oS i can install a guest OP sys like ubuntu and it wil cm wit its own binaries & lib files
  so in the guest op we assign 8GB ,,, it is possible to v a guest op sys on the phy sys .. wit the help of softwares called hypervisor... i can v as many guest sys on the 
  host sys e.g centos, windows2019, ,,on the guest systems i can deploy my appl or multiple web appl 
  but in the traditional approach all the application wil be installed on jst one op sys and the disadv is that ders no isolation, if ders a problem in one appl it is 
  possiblre to affect the others bt with virtualized approach we ar able to isolate 
  trad was very common right uo to the 1980s and virtualized deployment ihas been used7 right up to the 2000s

  thers a more powerful approach called containers,
 CONTAINERS its very common today
CONtainers ar  dynamic bc it is nt tied to any infrastructure , can run on any computer, infrastructure n cloud 
it mean dercan b an aplica tht can only be deployed on a particualar op sys b4 it can run bt containers can run on any op sys bt containers does nt req an entire guest sys

  so again we hv an op sys that comes wit bin files n lib, running on a phy sys ,, before deploying any appl we install a containerization software and genrally its docker
18:00  ders ar others as well,, we ar now able to deploy our appl as containers ,, appl are nt deployed in virtual machines bt as containers, light weight conatiners  
e.g  we hv 90 containers deployed and are running, the appl does nt req an entire guest sys.. e.g d appl size can be for appl 1 ;cpu 400mb n memory of 32mb n its light 
  weight compared to virtualized

  d virtualized nid an entire guest op sys wich comes wit its own file n lib bt for containerisation, al d containers share d kernel e.g lib n binary file, so virtualzation
  doesnt require a guest sys
  therfore ths virtualized system has a faster start time to install, it starts up very fast like a cheetah n the integration is very easy than virtualization

OPTIONS TO USE FOR DEPLYMENT

 1) Traditional/Physical Deployment
 2) Virtualized Deployment (Hardware level Isolation) 
 3) Containerized Deployment(OS/Process level Isolation)

Docker -- Is a containerization software use to create, build
          ship and deploy applications as containers
            Build applications  
            ship applications  
            deploy applications  

IQ: How many environment are you supporting in your CURRENT role??
         Development environment    
         Testing/QA environment    
         Production environment 
In docker applications run as containers   
******33:07 .. e.g we v repos in git hub we wnt to deploy tonthe dev env using our vm/ec2 instances, on the instance, if i wnt to instal tomcat i v to first install all its
dependencies java then once the tomcat is installed i v my appl running
then to the test env, the same task is been done , lots of repitition and the same in production
bt ders the possiblity that smt is workiing in in one stg bt its nt working in the oda n dev can tell u its working in dev env bt when u tk it to prod its nt working n dis
a serious problem
we mk use of containers to resolve or avoid all dis issues

Containers --> contains everything required for an application to run create or evry tin req for appl to run 
               (App Files (code), Dependencies 
              (Softwares +Libraries), ENV vars & Other Configuration files) 
              which is required for a piece of application/process to run.
          app.war   -----> can be deployed ina  Virtual Machine  n in the vm 
                           java and Tomcat installed and configured  


   app code     = app.war + 
for a java web app to be deployed
   Dependencies = tomcat9 + openjdk11+

   app code     = app.ear + 
for a ear app, we nid
   dependencies = openjdk11+ + jboss/wildFly 

   for standalone app , we nid 
app code     = app.jar + 
   dependencies = java1.8+    

 *****now the quetsion is whta can be done to be able to package d appl plus its dependencies n kip such dat if i wnt to deploy d appl all i hv to do is ship the app to 
the deployment enev and it come swit the dependencies alreday packgedmening ders nid going to the dev enev n carry out conf, test n run , wecan easily ship dis appli
how can we mk this process simplified?
therefore we will be usisng :
Containerization Software/Runtime --> : with this we can package an appl code plus its dependencies
 these ar the dif dockerization software
Docker, = over 80% usage , in the industry, it has the most level of trust
