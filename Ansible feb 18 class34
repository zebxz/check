 bc its not safe for sensitive info like passwd in an un encrypted format , ie anybody can view so we can use either hashicorp vault or ansible vault

HAshicorp vault:
it is used to create  and store secrets in hashicorp

ANSIBLE VAULT.:
===============    
stores and encrypt confidential or secrets  data. in ansible like:
 [password / sshkeys / tokens / certificates ]   


TO ENCRYPT MY all.yml file :
ansible-vault encrypt /etc/ansible/group_vars/all.yml

........... and you will be requested to setup a password after which when u cat your file ull see that your password has been encrypted
so the passwd to vars/all.yml file has been encrypted

now if i try to run a playbook conected with this file :
ansible-playbook vars2.yml

********** we get an error:, it says Attempting to decrypt but no vault secrets found 
therfore , i need to inform ansible to ask mef or the vault passwd 

**** ansible-playbook vars2.yml -ask-vault-pass


54:41
*****************
i can also create a file for my passwd
vi vault pass
then paste my passwd

***********  so now i can run:
 ansible-playbook vars2.yml -vault-password=vaultpass


****** so this is ansible for you
you can create a secret like a passwd and you can encrypt it using ansible vault 


ansible-vault decrypt /etc/ansible/group_vars/all.yml
ansible-vault view /etc/ansible/group_vars/all.yml
ansible-vault edit /etc/ansible/group_vars/all.yml
ansible-vault rekey /etc/ansible/group_vars/all.yml
ansible-vault create  /etc/ansible/group_vars/all.yml
