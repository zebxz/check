KEY CONCEPTS
Docker images :
Docker containers  
Dockerfile 
Docker Networks 
Docker volumes  
Docker compose  
Docker swarm 



Docker containers: Run time instance of a docker image. 
     If you execute: docker run, 
     a container is created from the image

Dockerfile :
    FROM tomcat:8.0.20-jre8    ......so tomcat:8.0.20-jre8 ... this is the tag
    COPY target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla.war  
***** so we hv tomcat 8.0.20 and java runtime 8


1)BUILD IMAGE
so we wnat to build our image and the command is  
  docker build -t teslaimage:1 -f Dockerfile /home/ubuntu/web/  
  docker build -t teslaimage:1 -f Dockerfile-tesla .  

we wnt to build our image, the command is docker build, + so i give a name to my image called telsa image, what version:version 1
am building frm a file , the file is called docker fileand its found in /home/ubuntu/web,,...wher am i building, docker build image 1


2)lets do docker run...  ie to create & deploy containers
docker run -d -p 80:8080 --name webapp teslaimage:1

we wn to deploy this application.. docker run , -d for detachable conatiner ,-p for port forwarding , port 80: marked to port 8080,wich is the port for tomcat
i wnt to deploy my appli and i can attach a name to my application (name webapp 0r tesla), so am deploying dis appl frm this image that has a tag as 1, bc docker
container is a runtime instance of a docker image 
so if i execute dis command:  docker build -t teslaimage:1 .  my webapp container wil be created frm dis docker image 

 after running dis : docker run -d -p 80:8080 --name webapp teslaimage:1
if i execute docker ps , i hv a container running 
docker run --name containerName -d -p hostPort:containerPort image:tag
  -d = detachable mode  
  -p = port Forwarding


share images
with the help of the repository u can push images to therepository
docker push markwellams/tesla-web-app:tagname



Docker images commands:
  docker build    = create a docker image from a Dockerfile  
  docker tag      = assigns repository name to images 
  docker tag  ,, we can tag an image
  docker images   = list images
  docker image ls = list images
  docker images -q = list image ids ONLY
 docker images  .,,, list images
- docker Registry - Where docker images are stored and distributed    
  - docker engine==- - Use by the docker service to execute tasks  e.g when u run docker build, u ar inform the daocker engine, tk dis instruction n build a docker image
the emgnine tks the instructions n assihn a tag to an image 



we can run "docker build" or "docker image build, but docker build is shorter
 also thers docker image history, docker image imort 
Commands:
  build       Build an image from a Dockerfile
  history     Show the history of an image
  import      Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more images
  load        Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN
  ls          List images
  prune       Remove unused images
  pull        Download an image from a registry  eg  Docker pull nginx
  push        Upload an image to a registry
  rm          Remove one or more images
  save        Save one or more images to a tar archive (streamed to STDOUT by default)
  tag         Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE
DELETE ALL IMAGES = ubuntu@docker:~$ docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
 FORCE DELETE AN IMAGE = docker rmi -f mylandmarktech/hello:latest = FORCE DELETE AN IMAGE  
DELETE SELECTED IMAGES USING THEIR ID :  docker rmi -f 61395b4c586d e88a065848be
docker stop container ids
to remove stopped container : docker rm container ids



  docker ps we see containers that are running like myapp,stop & app
to stop them; docker stop myapp app hello




DElETING IMAGES
  docker rmi imageName/imageID /imagetag      = DELETE AN IMAGE   
   FORCE DELETE AN IMAGE = docker rmi -f mylandmarktech/hello:latest = FORCE DELETE AN IMAGE  
                            docker rmi -f mylandmarktech/hello:latest 
                            docker rmi -f 

  to list image ids only = ubuntu@docker:~$ docker images -q  
61395b4c586d e88a065848be


Pull images from Public registry [dockerhub] : 
    No athentication is required

Pull images from private registry [ecr/dockerhub/nexus/JFrog] :
    Authentication is required   
    docker login -u username -p password 

push images to Public registry [dockerhub] :
      Authentication is required   
      docker login -u username -p password 

push images to private registry [dockerhub] :
      Authentication is required   
      docker login -u username -p password

if they are unable to access these links if ders  u'll get this 
https Errors and httpsError codes:
  httpStatus codes:
  400 errors = client side errors  
    401 = not authorised  
    402 = permission denied
    403 = forbidden
    404 = not found 
  500 errors = server side errors  
    501 / 502 / 503 =  mayb the server is down
  200 = in the 200 family means its ok  
  300 = redirect 


docker container commands:
docker kill wil stop the container without any waring, while docker stop will give u a warning

netstat" TO KNW WHAT PORT NUMBER TO USE AS THE HOST PORT 
to check the ports in use, we can run netstat -tulpn , n i can see the all the ports in use
to install netstat : sudo apt install net-tools


How to troubleshoot issues or debug applications running as docker containers?
1. docker ps -a =
= will check if the container is running, paused or exited
 docker start/unpause
then docker ps -a ,to check if it stopped
if its in stop state , u strt the container
but if it not stopped but the process is stopped u hv to unpause it
﻿﻿﻿2) docker top = check resources, to check the process running inside a container 
﻿﻿﻿3) docker stats containerNAME/ID
﻿﻿﻿4) docker logs containerNAME/ID      docker 5&6 ********* also if der ar issues in the container, we can track them frm the log files
5) ﻿﻿﻿docker exec = run command inside the container
docker exec app 1s 
***meee*** interactive mode****  docker exec -it app/bin/bash
7)﻿﻿﻿docker inspect containerNAME/ID   
 docker inspect  ... "will show us network ie is the container in a ntwrk" does it v ip adress, a container thats running we shud see the ip address in networks
and we can see the state as shown below that the container is nt running based on my inspeection, so we can start d container to solve the problem bc d container is exited
e.g
***  most of the time when we look at networking after we kill a container n start a container, we ll see the ipadresss will change
8)99﻿﻿﻿docker attach containerNAME/ID
﻿﻿﻿netstat -tulpn
5) docker update container name/id
 docker diff

docker 5&6 ********* also if der ar issues in the container, we can track them frm the log files
 How processes are running.     1.21.00*** a container can be killed bc of resources issues

we can also check the statistics
docker stats containerNAME/ID = = check resources 
      "OOMKilled": false,  (out of memeory)

INSIDE CONTAINER
to run command inside a container
﻿﻿﻿docker exec app pwd 
﻿﻿﻿docker exec app ls   .. to see the files

INTERCATIVE MODE
we can actually get into the container to execute command by accessing the container in intercative mode
docker exec -it app   .. for interactive mode
to interact with the container we nid a shell
so we can use a bash shell  .. : docker exec -it app bash
or bond shell sh


                              COPY FROM & TO A CONTAINER
 A)  copy from a container ; docker cp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/home.jsp
                                 ***online
                             docker cp my_container:/app/source_directory/container_file.log ./local_destination/
                                       
    B) Copy to a/(same) container ;  docker cp home.jsp webapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/tesla/jsps/
                                    ** online
                             Copying a file from the host to a container:
    docker cp ./local_file.txt my_container:/app/destination_directory/


DOCKER 5B 
about pausing the process   
i can pause to TS
if u deploy an appli n its running , n now thers an info u wnt to update on the container
so u can pause the container process so that users cant access it until u v fixed it
### WE pause and hv to unpause when we are done updating
