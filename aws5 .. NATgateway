2:38:10????nginx  didnt work when i tried to access it in google,i couldnt acces apache websever even after opening port80 in inbound rule of d jumpserver ngnix was instaled
sudo yum install ngnix
ngnix is a software for webserver, http is also a software for webserver
###2:44:00 we had to open http port80 in jumpserver for ngnix to be accessible
he was suppose to install ngnix in the webserver bt he couldnt acess it, then realised that he put the webserver in the privateSN inatead of the publicSN, so instaed of 
making anoda webserverSO he decided to install ngnix in the jumpserver which is in the publicSN

he installed httpd
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl enable httpd 
sudo systemctl status httpd
using the ip address access apache webserver on google ,, bt we were unable so we had to open the port in inbound rule and open port80 
http, tcp 80 , frm anywer.. save

vpc is my isolated ntwrk within aws that i can control
subnets are created inside our vpc
am able to create an instance e.g a web sever in my subnet 
vpc is a regional service in aws
i can create my subnet in us west-2a  avai zone 
subnet is an avail zone resource
vpc ar global reource
its nt advisable to launch all my subnets in the same avail zones
 i needed a vpc so it can enable me to create other subnets wher i can place my resources

when i hv a vpc i hv to create a cyber block
we wnt to det hw many subnets can a vpc hv
when we created our resources wit aws it came wit a default vpc created by aws
so we hv:
aws default vpc created by aws .. its nt adviceable to launch my servers in the default
17:20 aws custom vpcs created by the user.. this has more security and more contrl over my resources
so far we hv been using default vpc
the vpc we are creating wil be a regional service


in aws we have:
1 global resources
2 regional resource
3 avail zones resource 
subnets

1:00:10 my s3 bucket canot be be created in a subnet, e.ginside us east2a subnet ..bc its a regional service i can create it in the us region inside my vpc e.g us east,us west
1:04:for e.g, if i v app server1 and app server2, to ensure comunication btw the servers, i can create a route table, wich detr hw service is routed from one subnet to d oda
 inside our vpc we nid internet gateway  it will allow internet to flow into the vpc & it wil allow exteral traffic so if we wnt to acess resourcs out of our vpc, out of our,
netwrk , we nid to hv internet , using IGW , ders a kind of internet gateway, it is associated wit our vpc.

1:07:00 inside the vpc we'l create route tables, route table1 for the private subnet to support local traffic within my vpc, then route table2, i hv a public subnet 
wich is wher i place resources wich can be acessed externaly & the route table2 is permitting traffic frm anywher . ie 0.0.0/0, both local& traffic frm the internet..

1:34:00 if my private app server is trying to access data online e.g ping google.com, il modify route table1, create a NAT gateway  to permit oneway internet traffic,therefore
the app server can access internet externally, i decide that we can recieve traffic frm the internet but can only happen frm the nAT gateway.
 the NAT will be created in the public subnet wich hv internet access,, from der, the private subnet is permitted to access internet via the NAT gateway

1:12:24 vpc has some firewall ,2 types of firewall, the first one stands infront of the subnet, like a gateman, netwk acess control list nACL... in naCL, we can create
some rule e.g open port80 for inbound rules &for outbound open port80 aswell,, we open port 443 as well, wit dis ports open, trafic frm enduser can get to my subnet
for  trafic to get to the webserver ,in front of my webserver thers another layer of security ie security group, so i v to open port80 , 443 
****** in  all we hv 2 security parameter
the 1st is the router for routing, wich permits traffic to be routed to the subnet
the 2nd is the firewall wich has 2layers of security,, security at the subnet level & security at the server level

1:20:40 ,, u cannot delete a vpc that has dependencies ie servers, u must delete the servers first

1:26:00  create vpc 
search vps in aws- crreate vpc- vpc&more- auto generate:name -10.0.0/224- no ipv6-  tenancy:default,/dedicated u pay more- no of azs 2/ we can 
customize -no. of public 2- NAT 1- VPC endpoint:S3 GATeway - then create vpc.

when we select vpcm&ore,to create subnet options are avail bt if we select  vpc only, then we hv to create subnets after the vpc has been created
1:48:16 to create subnets -subnets-choose vpc for subnet-IPv4 VPC CIDR block:e.g 10.0.0.0/24, =256ips, then we creat 1st subnet: IPv4 subnet CIDR block 10.0.0.0/25 =128ips
then a 2nd vpc 10.0.0.128/25 =128ips ,, so in total we hv 256ips in 2subnets.
2)nxt create internate gateway- internate gate- name- create gateway
3) to get traffice : internet gateway-actions:atach to vpc- slect vpc - attach.. so my vpc can now get traffic frm the internet
4)route table-create-name:private/PUB -vpc to use route table - create.. we can edit .. click selected route-action:edit route-
target:local-add route- destination:0.0.0/0-select internt GW frmdrop box:indicating the particular gateway- save changes.
5)to assocaite the route table to my subnet :click selected subnet(public)-action:edit subnet association- tick the (public) 
subnet-save ... 1:52:30  
6) click private table-action:edit subnet association-tick private subnet-save

so dat servers in my vpc can communic, instances can communi wit each oda via ssh- launch ... we opened http 80 for nginx

1:58:50 the private ip  10.0.0.244 is deter by my cyber block which is 10.0.0.0/25 

launch dbserver -name-t2 micro-ntwrk:select vpc created:privatesn-AUTO ASSign:diassble- SG - ssh tcp22, cutom:10.0.0/24 to alow ntwk witin my vpc-launch 
to access dbserver i must connect to my jumpsevre before i can access the dbsever 


 2:00 security is inherent in our environment , WE DNT ALLOW DIRECT acces in our db server, if u wnt to acces it u v to go tru our 
jump sevrer. traffic goes to the jummpsever bc it has a security grp dat is permitting the trafic, it allows trafic on port22 so  in d
 SG 22 is open for members of the team & my vpc 10.0.0.0/24,i.e my ip. so my ip & port22 ar d two access  
2:02:13 . security grp in frnt of the db server is only local so u can only access db server via the jumpsevr, the jumpserver acts as 
the entry point when it comes to ssh access,  frm d jump server u can access the app/ db servers,so any server in the vpc can be accessed
via the jump server. does d seceurity grp in my db sever permit trafic frm the jumpserver. if am outside the ntwrk of the vpc,to access
the jumpsever i nid the publicip of the jumpserver.
2;05:00 to access my jumpserver,ssh jumpservr in mobaxterm.
2:11:50 we can also aces the jumpserver wit the private ip if we are inside the vpc,e.g i can ssh to the jumpsevre frm my app server if my firewall permits it&dat is local 
access, bc they ar all resources witin my vpc

2:14:00 to connect to my dbserver, inside the jumpserver in mobax, vi dbkey i.e create a file&paste the dbkey, if i ll ,can see the key has read&write access so i v 
to chmod 400 dbkey to change it to read only .. then when i run ssh -i awskey33.pem ec2-user@10.0.0.54 ...v been able to ssh frm my jumpsevr to my dbserver
2:16:10 frm d dbserver when i ping google.com, it doesnt allow but when i ssh into my jumpserver again in mobx i get a response when i ping google.com
for my dbserver to be able to commu with google we hv to create a NAT gateway
2:18:50 create NAT GATEway - vpc- NATgateway- name-publicSN-connectivity:public- click allocate elastic- create
we go back to the private route table -i wnt my private subnet to access internet, so via the NAT one way internet traffic -edit routes-add route:0.0.0/0/NATgateway:select
the NATgateway that was just created- create
so my private subnet now has internet traffic via the NATgateway & my dbserver is able to access internet via the NAT gateway.

2:25:00 
OUR WEBSERVER is found the public subnet,we hv 2layers of security in front of the webserver, the 1st is NACl.. ntwk acess contl list wich wil control the whole ntwrk, 2nd 
layer of security is the secrutity grp ,, when end user traffic gets to the webserver running in my public subnet, it means the req port has been open , so in my NACL
inbound rule il open: rule1 port80, port443 for http&https respectively, in my Sg il ALSO OPEN PORT80 &443. so traffic comes to my webserver bc webser is listenig on those
port number, port80&443... frm here, my appserver runs in private subnet &also my dbserver
2:28:42 also for my appsevr i hv 2layer of security, one in front linking frm the webservr & one behind linking the dbserver

2:29:18 launch webserver - linux-micro- select VPC created- publicSN-auto:enable- SG:ssh tcp22/custom myip & ssh tcp22 custom 10.0.0.0/24 &ssh orhttp tcp 80 bc users can 
cm frm anywher &https 443 frm anywher- launch  ......correction.... publicSN...... not privateSN
since it is within my netwrk , i ssh with my private ip, i use my prive bc i wnt to ssh bt if i wanted endusers to access the webserver, il give them public..

users access our webseevr via ---->http/80, https/443 webserver [13.59.100.138]    
  admin ---->ssh/22 .. can use either of private or public.. he can use both 

2:38:25 our webserver is running in the public subnet which has route to the internet via the internet gateway
i think its bettr to use the same key for all the jump,db,&webserver so that  no nid to chmod 400 multiple times,, if i use the same key, once i chmod once for dbserver,
i dnt nid to chmod again when i ssh the webserver
