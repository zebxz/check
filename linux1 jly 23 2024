******* From bootcamp Dec26 

CHRIS  said he was using jenkins to do a build but was always having a fail

proff:
    if theres a problem ,you dnt just first dive into your pom.xml file
the first thing is to check the logs, if we are building in jenkins, thats what we call console output 
u go to the console output and try to identify what cud be the cause of the problem, if the cause of the problem will need that i get into pom.xml to check then il do that 
if the cause is for you to talk to dvelopers to inform them to check their code , it cannot runbc the compilers they hv defined is the wrong compilers they shud check
their pluggins , the pluggins defined in pom.xml are not th epluggins the job neeeds to run , so they shud wrk on it and define the correct pluggins , 
so if theres a problem check the logs

    Thank you for this question

in my env i am incharge of manging artifacts , and as part of my job, i set up my nexus artifactory  by creating a nexus serevr, ensuring that nexus is fully installed, 
ensure thats its running as expected, i create artifactories, repositories in nexus n i use the artifcatory  repository url to modify my project file which is pom.xml,
this wil permit us to upload artifacts into this artifcatories, when we build frm the development branch, artifacts are uploaded into the nexus releases repository .. 59:00
when we build form the master or the relaese branch, artifacts are uploaded into the release repository
i was tasked to upload some artifacts into the release repository and i realised for some reason i kept getting build fail and when i checked the logs i realised i was using 
the wrong version in my pom.xml, instaed of ensuring that the versioning is tagged to releases it was tagged to snapshot, so i quickly went to my pom.xml modified the version
used the corret version which was snapshot and once i had to rebuld again via my pipeline that failure never existed because it was now uploading artifacts into the snapshot
repository that was expected.

                              LINUX
            WHAT IS A COMPUTER ?
    A computer is an electronic device that can store, process and display information
Its a device with both hard and software componentsused to run task and processes
computer hardware: comes with modarboard, keyboard, RAM, mouse, harddrive, CPU, cards, screen/monitor etc

 SOFTWARE COMPONENTS
1) OS- Operating system which is the heart of a computer 
2) other softwares: microsoft office, adobe reader, antivirus , sublime etc


   VENDORS /MANUFACTURERS
Lenovo/dell/hp/apple/Acer/asus/toshiba


     CLASSIFCATION OF COMPUTER  
Personal computers:
Desktop, laptop,/ipad/ tables/ phones/notebook/watches etc 


    ENTERPRISE COMPUTERS
workstation, servers (super computer)


The operating system running in a computer defines the computer type
OP - os 
windows os
linux os
solars os
mac os
ios os
android smartphones (smasung motorola)
if a lenovo laptop is running linux os = linux system
hp laptop is running with solar os - sloars system
dell ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, windows os - windows system

can i change my os from linux to windows and vice versa --- YES
can a computer have more than 1 os at once??? 99%
window -WSL (Windows subsystem for linux) to make my computer hvlinux components and so i can perfomr linux task on it 
 Hypervisor --- virtual machines 
with hypervisor we can install virtual machines on our hardware/computer/systems

WHAT DETERMINES THE CHOICE OF AN OS (COMPUTER SYSTEM)
1) SECURITY:
85% OF our servers are linux based
linux systems are not vulnerable to virux attack
windows systems are vulnerable to virus attack

eg youare exempted/free from sickness
be sick and get treated

2) cost 
linus is a freee and open source OS
windows is a lincencensed and paid OS

3) support 
linux has a very large effective and free community support (200m people)
windows support is available only from microsoft (100m people) but paid 
eg   1m possible helpers to resolve my issue for free
      1k possible helpers to resolve my issue at a cost


4) usage
linux oS mostly utilized for enterprise tasks eg creating servers
windows is mostly utilized as a workstation

5)performance
6) Reviews
7) speed
8) scalability and elasticity - ie can it be scaled ?


       WHAT KIND OF WORKLOADS CAN BE EXECUTED ON COMPUTER SYSTEM?
Create files, modify files, watch movies, create subfolders, gaming, trading, to backup data bases, amage websites, download files.


  HOW ARE TASKS EXECUTED/PERFORMED ON A COMPUTER SYSTEM
1) gui CONSOLE: Graphic user interface
         graphic user - 2hours
       25000 UI ---- 65k usd per 
2) CLI - command line interface (accomplish task faster)
         command user  --5 min
    Engineers/administartors -120k - 400k per yr
powershell
gtbash
terminal - mac OS

using CLI we can use gitbash and perform task faster than GUI

                  **** we need an SSH client software to connect to telsa server                           AWS

********* Telsa will have her servers located in a cloud environment /provider



        LINUX OS AND LINUX COMMANDS: Mobaxterm
linux is an open source operating system
linux started around 1991 by linus torlvads


linus was using a solar system for his project when he ecountered a problem while running his project, he tried seeeking help but the vendor fo rthe solars must be contacted
for help so he decided to create something else that can be easily for help and for free

working on his project using a solar system, linus created the linus OS from the soars kernel/os 
linux is an open source OS with multiple distributors and or versions
windows, solars, MacOS, etc are licenced OS 


      HOW CAN SOFTWARES BE PROVIDED?
SOFTWARES can be provided as??
1)open source software (free with the source code) 
open source softwares has more community support

2) free softwares:
free but without the source code  (recipe) 

3) lincenced softwares: (paid for windows os, office 365)


    EXPLAIN YOUR EXPERIENCE IN OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGY
Linux with open source technologies the software is free
including the source code (recipe/secrets of the biz)


    TICKET 0014

SSH - secure Shell is the protocol use to connect to linux Systens.


***** the steps

1) log into my aws accout,       ( rootuser to login to aws u need email&paaswd bt for i am user: i am username/acc no. passwd
                                   rootuser not safe bc it gives access to do evrytin, so if anyone has access to your account, he has access to do everythin
                                        but i am user is more secured, it has higher level of security
2) launch my instance 
Go to aws.amazon.com then  select console, login to my AWS account using my username(email) and password
TO LAUNCH INSTANCE:
go to ec2 and select launch instance (which is a virtual server in the cloud)
Name the server - Demo 33
select Amazon linux 
create the key  --- key33 (rsa & select pem)
  then launch, always select the public ip address

3)open mobaxerm using my instance key 
to ACCESS my instance/server, i need mobaxterm
so i go to my start bar/serach & click mobaxterm
when it opens go to sessiona and then select session
then SSH
Remote host -- is my ip address
specify username  -- ec2-user
select advanced settings & select use private key, go to my downloads and select private key (key33)

**** to access my instance/server i need identification& authorization uisng either a password or username

********** open ssh port22 on server firewall or security group, if the port is not open i cant access the server


   *** 1:39/ 1;40                           TO CONNECT TO YOUR EC2-instance CONNECT TO YOUR LINUXSERVER IN AWS USING AN SSH CLIENT
1) ssh-client software  (provide a passage)
mobaxterm, putty, gitbash
download and install mobaxterm ssh-client software 
https://download.mobatek.net/2312023031823706/mobaxterm_installer_V23.1.zip
2)server identification = public ip address & the default username
remote host address - publicip=44.208.35.48
3)Authentication= passwordor a private ssh key  = key33.pem   , authenticated username = ec2user
ssh ec2-user@44.208.35.48 / ssh-ikey33.pem ec2-user @44.208.35.48
4)Authorization : what do you want to do in the server/task that a user is authorised to execute
5)open ssh -port = 22 on the server firewall/security group
