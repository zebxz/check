WE ARE GOING TO SEE HOW TO USE ELASTICSEARCH, KIBANA AND BEATS

we are talking bout elastic stack , lock stack and kuberna or elastic stack fibric and kuberna
we are goin to be deploying this stack in our k8 cl8 using helm


REASON WE NID TO DO THIS:        **************** powerpoint
monitoring, alertingand log aggregationare essential for the smooth functioning of a production grade k8 cl8

e.g 
when u want to access an applictaion that is running, in k8 we can check the logs
kubectl get pod
we see the pods that are running in the defaulf dev space
NAME                        READY     STATUS
hello-app-6hztm              1/1         running
tdapp-759f7c6687              1/1         running

we can check the logs of ecah of the appl
we can describe the pod
kubectl describe  tdapp-759f7c6687     
OR check/get the logs  of the pod
kubectl logs tdapp-759f7c6687     
we can see the appl was deployed using the spring booth frame work
if u look at the appl, you can visualize the logs
********************if ders anytin wrong with your appl you can check the logs it will tell whats happening

############## kubectl get deploy
NAME                      READY         
ngninx-nginx-ingress        1/1
tdapp                       2/2 

**************** kubectl logs tdapp
Error from server (Not found): pods tdapp not found 
####################### ie it has to be in pods to check the logs , ( run kubectl get pod, first before running kubectl get logs tdapp)

*****************************  9:10
##############  but when u have multiple appl and ther are issues,
kubectl get pod -A        * TO get all the pods in all the name spaces
we see all the pods running
NAMESPACE            NAME    
apm                 grafana
apm                 promethus
kube-system         cluster-autoscaler-6cf74d69f7
grafana pod is running
the alertmanger   , incharge of sending alert, if smt is going wrong 
kubestate -maetrics ttaht gathr all the data, whatever is happening within our k8 objects eg pods, deplyment, rs, rc,  even nodes
node exporter is also gathering whatererv is happening in the nodes, the metrics  node exporter is gathering them 
promrthus sererv pod , it will scrap all of this data into the promethus  time series databasea nd once the dta has been scrapped we can visualise what is hapening using 
grafana

**************** so if we hv 100 pods we cant be running kubectl for all of the pods, that will be a tidious task
kubectl logs cluster-autoscaler-6cf74d69f7
ERROR form server not found clustr-autoscaler      ************************** this is bc we didnt check in the correct namespace (we nid to pass the namespace)
kubectl logs cluster-autoscaler-6cf74d69f7 -n kube-system
the logs are successfully generated                     8:25

HOW ARE WE ABLE TO CENTRALIZE OUR LOG MGT  ************************ powerpoint 12:40
we can use Elastic stack along with Docker to collect, process, store and visualize logs of microservices

WHAT IS ELASTIC STACK  .........................the vendor is ELASTIC
its an open source app from elastic designed to take data From any source and in any format and then search, analyze,and visualize that data in real time.
it was formely known as ELK stack, in wich the letters in the name stood for the appl in the grp. Elasticsearch, lahstack,and kibana. A fourth app, Beats, was 
subsquently added to the stack.

ELATICT search: ie now we can use elastic stack to staore data and to index the data, indexing streamas of semi-structured data, e.g logs or decoded ntwrk packets.
************* so elastic search will act as a container, it will store all the logs  ...... this i sthe use of elastic stack, it also does indexing.
it will index the logs , so when the logs are inside elastic search or the semi structure data n some ntwrk packages are inside elasticsearch waht happens is 
elasticsearch can do indexing, it will index the logs , it will perform indexing ,indexing is just like a pattern , lets assume it wants to cfreate an index which is goin
to like be displaying logs on a timestamp basis so that whatever is happening in the cl8 , u can use ur timestamp to know aht is goin on, so that can tk place, therfore
elastic search is goin to act as a store n a kind of an analyzer.. thats what elastic search is goin to do.
once the logs are stored, the next thing is that we want to visuaize these logs and we can use kibana  .... (THE SAMe way we saw grafana)

KIBANA: is an open source analytics and visualizationplatform designed to work with elasticsearch. it can be used to search,view n interact wit data stored in elasticsearc
indices, allowing sadvanced dtaa analysis n visualing dta in a variety of charts, tables n maps

the nxt componant is called beats
BEATS: open source data shipprs that can be installed as agents on servers to send operational data directly to Elasticsearch or via logstash, wher it can be further
processed n enhanced.
Therea re a number of beats for diff purposes.
