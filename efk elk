check the EFK/ ELK powerpoint
we are talking bout elastic stack , lock stack and kuberna or elastic stack fibric and kuberna
we are goin to be deploying this stack in our k8 cl8 using helm


REASON WE NID TO DO THIS:        **************** powerpoint
monitoring, alertingand log aggregationare essential for the smooth functioning of a production grade k8 cl8

e.g 
when u want to access an applictaion that is running, in k8 we can check the logs
kubectl get pod
we see the pods that are running in the defaulf dev space
NAME                        READY     STATUS
hello-app-6hztm              1/1         running
tdapp-759f7c6687              1/1         running

we can check the logs of ecah of the appl
we can describe the pod
kubectl describe  tdapp-759f7c6687     
OR check/get the logs  of the pod
kubectl logs tdapp-759f7c6687     
we can see the appl was deployed using the spring booth frame work
