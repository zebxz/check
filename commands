****without git init command, that is not a development repository, it  will not support any git command
git log           = to list the number of commit that we have 
                     ( so we git commit  -m "first version", then git log) then we get the commit id

git add filename : git add boo
one file 
git add filename

git add.
many files
git add*

In our staging area  >>>>>>>>>>>> local repository
