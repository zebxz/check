Dynamic Inventory:
=================
Dynamic Inventory uses scripts and Plugins to classify hosts from a cloud provider.
  appservers  
  dbservers  
  webservers  
  devServers   
The default ansible static host file  = /etc/ansible/hosts   
The custom ansible  static host file  = anywhere in the server 
                                       /home/ansible/hosts 
                                       /tmp/hosts  
                                        /home/ansible/myhosts
 scripts:
    ec2.py  and 
    ec2.ini 
 
 Plugins:
  ec2       
sudo yum -y install python3-pip                               ********** first install python p
sudo apt -y install python3-pip
pip3 install boto3 botocore --user                           ****** if you are installing for a particular user
pip3 install --upgrade requests --user                        ******* then upgrade



we hv an aws account so
Ansible will fetch and group servers/hosts/ec2                *********   and in ansible servers are called ec2

vi dynamic-inventory-aws_ec2.yml  
vi dynamic-inventory.yml


                                 ******** this is infrastructure as a code

you will assign an IAM role to your ANsible control server with REQ permissions to grup servers
and when we use roles, confidential details are not displayed (the key info)

*****************

54.175.72.219 ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/tmp/class35.pem                   ******** but with dynamic we dont have this file

19:41  
when we create a server in aws it comes with an ssh private key 
and when connecting to your ubuntu server for the first time you:
ssh -i demo.pem ubuntu@172.31.80.9
when we create a server for the first time, it doesnt come with an ansible user , 
cos when you pass smt like this it means you wnat to use a default user, but thers no default user 
so it is presummed that this servers hv just been created so if we want to ping the server, we can only ping the server with the default user that the server came with
so we run the command like user , w ewant to ping the server with user ubuntu 


                             "  the inventory file"               
ansible-playbook test.yml -i di-aws_ec2.yml -m ping -u ubuntu --private-key=/tmp/key.pem           ** playbk called test.yml, whterver we wnt to do is defined in the playbk 
                                                      ec2-user                                                     the key is found in /tmp

*********** some of the servers were nt able to ping bc they are ec2 not ubuntu 
so we can also change the user to ec2-user


24:40                                             ********  -l means limit  or --limit
ansible-playbook test.yml -i di-aws_ec2.yml -m ping -u ubuntu --private-key=/tmp/key.pem -l app     ******* to ping only the app servers 

28:20  cant terminate the servers some created c5 servers in his aws account 
so he wants to recycle his key

**********************  so we hv seen how to use dynamic inventory to achieve specific tasks 

41:10
************* lets assume thers a jenkins integration job we will look at 
but in my github env with dynamic inventory , i hv this job , i want to install tomcat , this is my yml file to install tomcat

using dynamic inventory
ansible-playbook tomcat.yml -i di-aws_ec2.yml -u ec2-user --private-key=/tmp/key.pem -l tomcat           **** limiting the installation to only tomcat server 
                                                                                       **** tomcat server
        
******* in our inventory, in our etc/ansible host, we dnt hv any list of tomcat servers but we hv a tomcat server here 
so please this is dynamic inventory 
when it appears in yellow , it shows that an action is taking place 
there was no failed action/task job, 


************ 
 in our bootcamp, we are goin to see, as a matter of fact i already created a github repository for jenkins ansible intergration 
we will see hw jenkins will work with ansible
this configurtaion that we ddid here we are goin to do it frm ansible, so evrythin will be automated 
we will est full automation wher we are goin to hv a cp
we are goin to use terfrm to create our tomcat server and once the server is created, dynamically it will trigger a downstream job that will configure the tomcat server
once that is done , the ci job also will be triggerred, we will see all of that in bootcamp
