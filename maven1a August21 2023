                                              buildscript

for our test and build we are using maven
so our build server is aven which will clone codes and for it to run code the git clone has to be installed as well  


developers are writing uunit test cases, build script, raw/sourec code , the codes cant run directly in the client server so it has to go through build phase/sever
therefore we will do the test&build 
in the building process the build platform is going to connect this raw code INTO PACKAGES that the app servers in the client environment can understand
the test and build process ensures that the app servers can make business logic out of the raw codes developed by developers
so the raw code goes through the test and build process before it is developed to the client environment 

so we are talkining abt build and how we can do a build for application code & principlally we will be using amven as a build tool
