MY QUESTION:

                                    watch the video again and verify no. 9  **** bt i can also ask prof  , in what branch do we run git push ??
No. 9       
 git merge dev               = if we are satisfied with the changes (done in master in local repo)     ****** i think this is an error cos i thought the push was to master
10) git push aliasName --all     = git push pp --all      ******* in what case scenario can dis happen, to push to all, and frm what branch is this command ran



jenkins 1&2 
5:30 ...... commit is a function of branches


whatever paypal is going to do is captured as releases



we hv to ensure that we hva local repository in our env by runing :
git remote add paypal https://github.com/zebxz/paypal
ie we choose any alias name of our choice in this case' paypal' and with the url of our remote repo , we create/add a local repo in our environment 

****** to check if w ehv a local repo in our env we run:   git remote -v 
to push from our local repo to remote repo = git push (aliasName) master



from the diagram below, i bliv in each developers local env there is a working area, staging area and local repo/master (i bliv also called master)
so working area, the files are moved to the staging area then to the local repo and from there to the dev branch in the  remote repo in github
from his diagram of github,  i bliv since we push frm our local repo which we called paypal ( paypal signifies the pushes that were made from our local repo which we called 
paypal). while master is the master branch which i sthe final stage that leads us to production 




                                                  MANAGING APPLICATIONS
             APPLICATIONS ARE THE OUTPUT FROM SOFTWARES


This process includes develops, tests, builds, deploy and monitors applications
our main focus is on development and when applications are developed multiple versions of the application can be developed

we need to use a version control system that brings all the advantages of version control and that is a distributed version control system

a good example of DVCs is git
in our environment (landmark) WE USE git for versioning 


     STAGES OF DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS


  working area        staging     localRepo     RemoteRepo[GitHub]    :
  -----------        -------      ---------     ------------------  
  Untracked files     git add     git commit    git push 
    red                green     https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/paypal.git


                   GIT PULL/CLONE
Git pull: pulls changes to your local environment
git clone: downloads a version of the entire development work to your local environment

repoURL =  https://github.com/zebxz/paypal
 git clone  = https://github.com/the peson's organisation name/repository name

this is done to be able to pull  the task done by others to my own local environment/working area
then i have to config to be able to execute the same commit/ be part of the project
this is to be done by each member/collaborator of the project


                   OR 
Git pull (the persons repo name) master

                                            GIT BRANCH
   one branch = 1line of production
A branch is a line of development 
 A file must have been moved to the staging area before it can be pushed

dvelopment branch : writing our cde
stage branch : then moved to stage and once its done
master branch: deployed to production environment , taken to the market



***** in development its good to have multiple dev lines so that if there is an issue with on line, it can be resolved from the other line
 
******* The master branch is the upstreamBranch for the dev Branch  
  The dev branch is the downstream of the master branch   

Ticket01:
  Create a dev branch from the master branch  
  Switch to the dev branch and create the app.java file  
  Commit the changes and Switch to the master branch  
  Review the changes in dev and merge with the master branch  

 
Ticket01 answer:
  git branch branchName      = creates a new branch
  git branch dev             =  create dev from the master
  git switch dev             =  change from master to dev and vice versa
  git diff dev               =    commit ID  b0f7fcf  , run the command in the master branch to review what was done in the dev branch     
  git merge dev    
 


******* i think this was me summarizing the steps

1) git branch               = to confirm we have created dev
2)git branch dev             =  we run this command to create dev branch
3) git switch dev             =  change from master to dev and vice versa
4) we vi into app.java file
5)we git add.
6) we commit "m"
7) git switch :                 = move from dev to master
8)git diff dev (commit ID )    = we run this in master to review the changes that happened in dev             
                                  git diff (b0f7fcf) ie ID of the commit done in dev branch               
9) git merge dev               = if we are satisfied with the changes (done in master in local repo)     ****** i think this is an error cos i thought the push was to master
10) we ls  / get log       = to ensure all changes  from (git merge dev ) were applied in the master branch (ie we hv all the files/commit in the master )
11) git push aliasName --all     = git push pp --all ( this is done in master in our local repo )        ******* in what case scenario can dis happen, to push to all
                                     creates dev branch in remote repo and pushes the chnages from local repo to dev/master in remote repo


**********************   The master branch is the upstreamBranch for the dev Branch  
  The dev branch is the downstream of the master branch   


     

          TO BRING THE CHANGES FROM THE REMOTE REPO TO THE LOCAL REPO
         i bliv ie pull reQ, done in the remote repo


git fetch (aliasName) ie PP    =  



11)




 git push aliasName branchName  
eg;  git push pp master                   ***** Pushing to the master banch

git branch           = list the branchless 
git checkout/switch branch name =  git switch dev
git push aliasName --all  = push changes to all branches  ie to the master and dev branch in github
git push pp --all 
git branch - v             =  display all branches in your repo and also tell you what branch your currently working i
git remote remove alias Name    =  remove repo from the local environment 
git remote remove repo URL

with THE "git commit command -m " a version is created with a version number[commitID]  

git init          = to initialised a git empty repository
                    create the default branch[master, main]
git status        = to track files location
git log           = list all commits/versions     
git add           = move files to staging area from working area
git commit -m     = move files to the local repository FROM STAGING AREA
                    Creates a new version of the application
                    good commit message for tracking changes created by authors are recommended

Legah

  paypal-01 = Legah = git commit -m "First commit"    
  paypal-02 = Mary  = git commit -m ""    
  paypal-03 = Mary  = git commit -m    
  paypal-04 = Legah = git commit -m

Git Branch :
  In git a branch is a line of Development  
    development branch
    stage branch 
    master branch

        dev    [ rich / list.txt / deploy.sh  ] 
        stage  [ rich / list.txt / deploy.sh  ] 
        master branch [ rich / list.txt / deploy.sh  ] 

        dev   branch   ---> development environment  
        stage branch   ---> testing/UAT/QA environment  
        master branch  ---> production environment  



git branch -help  
==================

git branch branchName   = creates a new branch
git branch development  = created the development branch 

master branch is the upstream of the Development branch  

upstream branch = development :
  development branch =  usermgt.java  = 10,000 lines  
downstream branch = stage :
  git branch stage   =  usermgt.java  = 10,000 lines    


git switch master
git diff development 
git merge development



IQ: How many branches are you supporting in your projects?
    Branches are used to create lines of development in git. 
    A branch is a line of development 
 In our environment We maintain a minimun of 3 branches:
        development branch  
           app.java     
        staging branch  
           app.java
        master branch  
           app.java

  git branch  = list all the branches [lines of development]
  git branch branchName   = create a new branch     
  git checkout branchName = switch branches 
  git switch branchName = switch branches 

  git fetch --> It brings changes in the code to the LocalRepo
  git pull --> It brings changes in the code to the localRepoand & Working area 
  git clone --> It brings the entire code to the working area 

Pull Request- PR:
  PR is use to review changes in one branch before merging in another branch. 
  This is recommended for any merge in the master/release branch
