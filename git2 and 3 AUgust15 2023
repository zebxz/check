                                                  MANAGING APPLICATIONS
             APPLICATIONS ARE THE OUTPUT FROM SOFTWARES


This process includes develops, tests, builds, deploy and monitors applications
our main focus is on development and when applications are developed multiple versions of the application can be developed

we need to use a version control system that brings all the advantages of version control and that is a distributed version control system

a good example of DVCs is git
in our environment (landmark) WE USE git for versioning 


     STAGES OF DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS


  working area        staging     localRepo     RemoteRepo[GitHub]    :
  -----------        -------      ---------     ------------------  
  Untracked files     git add     git commit    git push 
    red                green     https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/paypal.git


                   GIT PULL/CLONE
Git pull: pulls changes to your local environment
git clone: downloads a version of the entire development work to your local environment

repoURL =  https://github.com/zebxz/paypal
 git clone  = https://github.com/the peson's organisation name/repository name

this is done to be able to pull  the task done by others to my own local environment/working area
then i have to config to be able to execute the same commit/ be part of the project
this is to be done by each member/collaborator of the project


                   OR 
Git pull (the persons repo name) master

with THE "git commit command -m " a version is created with a version number[commitID]  

git init          = to initialised a git empty repository
                    create the default branch[master, main]
git status        = to track files location
git log           = list all commits/versions     
git add           = move files to staging area from working area
git commit -m     = move files to the local repository FROM STAGING AREA
                    Creates a new version of the application
                    good commit message for tracking changes created by authors are recommended

Legah

  paypal-01 = Legah = git commit -m "First commit"    
  paypal-02 = Mary  = git commit -m ""    
  paypal-03 = Mary  = git commit -m    
  paypal-04 = Legah = git commit -m

Git Branch :
  In git a branch is a line of Development  
    development branch
    stage branch 
    master branch

        dev    [ rich / list.txt / deploy.sh  ] 
        stage  [ rich / list.txt / deploy.sh  ] 
        master branch [ rich / list.txt / deploy.sh  ] 

        dev   branch   ---> development environment  
        stage branch   ---> testing/UAT/QA environment  
        master branch  ---> production environment  

Ticket01:
  Create a dev branch from the master branch  
  Switch to the dev branch and create the app.java file  
  Commit the changes and Switch to the master branch  
  Review the changes in dev and merge with the master branch  

  The master branch is the upstreamBranch for the dev Branch  
  The dev branch is the downstream of the master branch   

Ticket01 answer:
  git branch branchName  
  git branch dev  
  git switch dev  
  git diff dev   
  git merge b0f7fcf     

git branch -help  
==================

git branch branchName   = creates a new branch
git branch development  = created the development branch 

master branch is the upstream of the Development branch  

upstream branch = development :
  development branch =  usermgt.java  = 10,000 lines  
downstream branch = stage :
  git branch stage   =  usermgt.java  = 10,000 lines    


git switch master
git diff development 
git merge development

git push aliasName --all  = push changes to all branches 
git push pp --all 


IQ: How many branches are you supporting in your projects?
    Branches are used to create lines of development in git. 
    A branch is a line of development 
 In our environment We maintain a minimun of 3 branches:
        development branch  
           app.java     
        staging branch  
           app.java
        master branch  
           app.java

  git branch  = list all the branches [lines of development]
  git branch branchName   = create a new branch     
  git checkout branchName = switch branches 
  git switch branchName = switch branches 

  git fetch --> It brings changes in the code to the LocalRepo
  git pull --> It brings changes in the code to the localRepoand & Working area 
  git clone --> It brings the entire code to the working area 

Pull Request- PR:
  PR is use to review changes in one branch before merging in another branch. 
  This is recommended for any merge in the master/release branch
