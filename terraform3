i cudnt install terrafrm

38:00 , watch what he did .........
remember when u intialize terfrm , u nid to be in the dir where your files are 

user data, boot straping, terfrm has built in functions ,  THERE ARE 2Wya we can PASS DATA, PROVISIONERS


########  am goin to intro u to anod IDE  i like using called itelligie     .............. 26:00
bt its nt any diff frm vscode

we use data sources to get info to return info for us frm an API, IF WE wnt 2 get info frm AWS, mayb frm a vpc, AN INSTANCE, a s3 bucket, this obj we wnt to get info abt,
first it has to exist,   so if we hv an ec2 instance tht exists we are able to get info abt the instance ,  the id , public addres, its dns 
so we can use a data source and pass in our filters and we are able to filter out all d amis that are der and we are ablle to return jst the value of what we nid
we use data source for automation bc as engr u dnt want to go to d console to manually copy an ami or any info/attribute,instaed u can automate d proces by runing a comand 
an data source wil go fast into aws , it wil get the attribute/info that u need n terrafrm gives u a way wherby u can aripolate that, u can pass d it directly to d resource 
ur creating

e.g 
if we were  creating an instance, bc we hv a data source dat we are using, we able to directly pass taht as our AMI, N what we are pasing is that attribute we wnt to get
. we knw that the AMI nids to b an id, so we ar using a data source as it reads data frm that particular AMI source, we wnt it to return an id n as it returns an id we are
directin paasing it to d resource so d data source gets the infpoo n we pass it as an input to our resource n this is how we use data source to provision our resource

INTERVIEW QUESTION
1)what is user data????
under whosee/which persmission will the instance b boot straping???  ... it wil use root permission
we hv a root usre whenevr ur instalin a pasvclkage it wil us ea root credential
2) what is booth straping???
the root user wil create ur default user and add them to d sudoers grp,that is the process of booth straping

we are using it for boot strapping, if we hv any nfo we want to pass to our instance
e,g in creatin an instance when u are passing user dta, when the instance is boot straping, it wil be bot straping with some permission
whgen u are boot straping an instance like linx or ubuntu, der wiul be a default user who is created, that is an ubuntu user
but who creats the  ubnuntu user when the instance is creatin,???????????????
der is root ,
the root user wil create ur default user and add them to d sudoers grp,that is the process of booth straping  so that this ubuntu has
permission to do what root can do
so when ur boot strapin naad ur using user data , the user data wil use rot permison, terfrm also gives us that option
*************************  24:30 ...
whenever we creatin an instance , in google he type aws_intsance terrfrm 
we see d arguments in alphabetical order and we can see user data , so i see i can pass in user data as a script,i can pass in as commands 
dat terfrm wil use when its boot straping dat  instance , it is going to create the instance


am goin to intro u to anod IDE  i like using called itelligie , its open source    .............. 26:00
bc of hw it organises my dir n files n am abale to easily look at my files like this
bt its nt any diff frm vscode
U CAN STILL Use ur vs code if u hv it , IDE is jst an integrated development env, der are multiple u can wrk with
as u continuie working u can xperiment n find out the one u prefer
********* for d sake of dis am goin to continue wit inteligie n put away my vscode bty its nt diff

**********28:20
i hv a data source for an amazonn linux 
a rsource for an instance i wnt to create
am nt hardcoding the value of d AMI, i using a data source to get my AMI
i can use a variable and call it  "instance type" .............................29.30
then i refer to this variable i created
i have a user data (a bash script) to install httpd , make a dir 
so this user data becomes my script that will booth strap when the instance starts
**************    am passing the user data as a file  and the file is in the PWD and its called app1-install.sh"


WATCH ............32:08   .. whenevr u use data ull pass it as a file, this is a function
in terfrm, it has what is called functions
if u google terfrm funtions , terfrm has built in functions ,   ther are various function for diff purposse
you can use dem to manipulate data 
e.g file function 
file reads the contents of a  file at a given path and returns  them as a a string
so when u use a file function , u wil nid to give it a path
we hv an example below
> file ("${path.module}/hello.txt")    ...... path.module indicates the file is in the PWD and then the name of the file ur passing
so the file function will read ("${path.module}/hello.txt") and return the content of that particular file     .....................................34.20
i also looka t my providers .....

anoda tin i will like to introduce to you guys is that i can open my IDE from here,
and as u begin to work esp in d industry u wil see that many engr prefrer to hav a terminal,that runs their code 

38:00 , watch what he did .........
remember when u intialize terfrm , u nid to be in the dir where your files are 


54.13************************ THERE ARE 2Wya we can PASS DATA
in the example we just illustrated above, we see that it was part of conggiguration, trefrm did provisioning , it provionsioned our instance but not only did it provision it
it also configured  it
the process of configuration is when ur installing softwRE, 
SO TRFRM gives us a way that not only can we provison our infrsastruture bt we can also configure it 
so this is alos part of config mgt, we can use a script, we can use user data to configure it 
but as we go on ill show u anoda way wich w ecall PROVISIONERS

so trfrm can aslo
