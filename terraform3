INTERVIEW QUESTION
1)what is user data????
under whosee/which persmission will the instance b boot straping???  ... it wil use root permission
we hv a root usre whenevr ur instalin a pasvclkage it wil us ea root credential
2) what is booth straping???
the root user wil create ur default user and add them to d sudoers grp,that is the process of booth straping

we are using it for boot strapping, if we hv any nfo we want to pass to our instance
e,g in creatin an instance when u are passing user dta, when the instance is boot straping, it wil be bot straping with some permission
whgen u are boot straping an instance like linx or ubuntu, der wiul be a default user who is created, that is an ubuntu user
but who creats the  ubnuntu user when the instance is creatin,???????????????
der is root ,
the root user wil create ur default user and add them to d sudoers grp,that is the process of booth straping  so that this ubuntu has
permission to do what root can do
so when ur boot strapin naad ur using user data , the user data wil use rot permison, terfrm also gives us that option
