AMIs are Region specific ................3:00:14

my QUESTION: How do you know areas that have default vpc ????????????????

i cudnt install terrafrm                       ............... ASSIGNMENT: 1:25:30

38:00 , watch what he did .........
remember when u intialize terfrm , u nid to be in the dir where your files are 

user data, boot straping, terfrm has built in functions ,THERE ARE 2Wya we can PASS DATA, PROVISIONERS, passing a key ,secret/ .gitgnoire, meta arguments, TYPES OF META 
ARGUMENTS , IMPLICIT/EXPLICIT Dependencies, converting list to set of string

########  am goin to intro u to anod IDE  i like using called itelligie     .............. 26:00
bt its nt any diff frm vscode




15:20
we use data sources to get info to return info for us frm an API, IF WE wnt 2 get info frm AWS, mayb frm a vpc, AN INSTANCE, a s3 bucket, this obj we wnt to get info abt,
first it has to exist,   so if we hv an ec2 instance tht exists we are able to get info abt the instance ,  the id , public addres, its dns 
so we can use a data source and pass in our filters and we are able to filter out all d amis that are der and we are ablle to return jst the value of what we nid
we use data source for automation bc as engr u dnt want to go to d console to manually copy an ami or any info/attribute,instaed u can automate d proces by runing a comand 
an data source wil go fast into aws , it wil get the attribute/info that u need n terrafrm gives u a way wherby u can aripolate that, u can pass d it directly to d resource 
ur creating

e.g 
if we were  creating an instance, bc we hv a data source dat we are using, we able to directly pass taht as our AMI, N what we are pasing is that attribute we wnt to get
. we knw that the AMI nids to b an id, so we ar using a data source as it reads data frm that particular AMI source, we wnt it to return an id n as it returns an id we are
directin paasing it to d resource so d data source gets the infpoo n we pass it as an input to our resource n this is how we use data source to provision our resource 



21:00
INTERVIEW QUESTION
1)what is user data????
under whosee/which persmission will the instance b boot straping???  ... it wil use root permission
we hv a root usre whenevr ur instalin a pasvclkage it wil us ea root credential
2) what is booth straping???
the root user wil create ur default user and add them to d sudoers grp,that is the process of booth straping

we are using it for boot strapping, if we hv any nfo we want to pass to our instance
e,g in creatin an instance when u are passing user dta, when the instance is boot straping, it wil be bot straping with some permission
whgen u are boot straping an instance like linx or ubuntu, der wiul be a default user who is created, that is an ubuntu user
but who creats the  ubnuntu user when the instance is creatin,???????????????
der is root ,
the root user wil create ur default user and add them to d sudoers grp,that is the process of booth straping  so that this ubuntu has
permission to do what root can do
so when ur boot strapin naad ur using user data , the user data wil use rot permison, terfrm also gives us that option
*************************  24:30 ...
whenever we creatin an instance , in google he type aws_intsance terrfrm 
we see d arguments in alphabetical order and we can see user data , so i see i can pass in user data as a script,i can pass in as commands 
dat terfrm wil use when its boot straping dat  instance , it is going to create the instance


am goin to intro u to anod IDE  i like using called itelligie , its open source    .............. 26:00
bc of hw it organises my dir n files n am abale to easily look at my files like this
bt its nt any diff frm vscode
U CAN STILL Use ur vs code if u hv it , IDE is jst an integrated development env, der are multiple u can wrk with
as u continuie working u can xperiment n find out the one u prefer
********* for d sake of dis am goin to continue wit inteligie n put away my vscode bty its nt diff

**********28:20
i hv a data source for an amazonn linux 
a rsource for an instance i wnt to create
am nt hardcoding the value of d AMI, i using a data source to get my AMI
i can use a variable and call it  "instance type" .............................29.30
then i refer to this variable i created
i have a user data (a bash script) to install httpd , make a dir 
so this user data becomes my script that will booth strap when the instance starts
**************    am passing the user data as a file  and the file is in the PWD and its called app1-install.sh"


WATCH ............32:08   .. whenevr u use data ull pass it as a file, this is a function
in terfrm, it has what is called functions
if u google terfrm funtions , terfrm has built in functions ,   ther are various function for diff purposse
you can use dem to manipulate data 
e.g file function 
file reads the contents of a  file at a given path and returns  them as a a string
so when u use a file function , u wil nid to give it a path
we hv an example below
> file ("${path.module}/hello.txt")    ...... path.module indicates the file is in the PWD and then the name of the file ur passing
so the file function will read ("${path.module}/hello.txt") and return the content of that particular file     .....................................34.20
i also looka t my providers .....

anoda tin i will like to introduce to you guys is that i can open my IDE from here,
and as u begin to work esp in d industry u wil see that many engr prefrer to hav a terminal,that runs their code 

38:00 , watch what he did .........
remember when u intialize terfrm , u nid to be in the dir where your files are 


54.13************************ THERE ARE 2Wya we can PASS DATA
in the example we just illustrated above, we see that it was part of conggiguration, trefrm did provisioning , it provionsioned our instance but not only did it provision it
it also configured  it
the process of configuration is when ur installing softwRE, 
SO TRFRM gives us a way that not only can we provison our infrsastruture bt we can also configure it 
so this is alos part of config mgt, we can use a script, we can use user data to configure it 
but as we go on ill show u anoda way wich w ecall PROVISIONERS

so trfrm can also give us a second method in which we can config our infarsture by using PROVIONERS ........................................55:11
    BUT AS U LOOK TRU documentation  , IT SAys use provisioners as a last resort
its nt the most recommemde way to do config bc of the nature of ehat provisioners do bc if a provioner fails, it will have to destroy the resource for it to be created again
thats why provisioners is a last resort

so if u want to do any config on ur instance esp as boot sratping then u cn pass user data


QUESTION
1)what do we do when we dnt knw the right attribute to pass???

ANS;
just depend on documnetation whener u are lost or smt isnt clear , like ur nt sure of what  attribute or argument ur suppose to pass
just cm to d dcoumentation n just look at arguments and attributes

2) we tried to create instance using a file but when we tried to create anoda instance , we realise that it destroys the first instance created, does that mean one file for 
one instance

ANS;
THats why we said st the first class that, you can creat as many type of instance as possible but what must be unique is your resource name 
the name must be unique to trfrm bc trfm keeps a atate file
when u try to create a 2nd instance wit the sam e resource name , whne trfrm check the statefile n your congiguration file, it doesnt see any diff so it will think u 
wnat to create the same instance again and so it will destroy the pevious one 
so lways make sure the name is unique

when we look at meta data shortly frm now, we will see we can create a resource even with the same name 
how we can cerate multiple resources even with the sam ename  , how terfrm handles that using meta arguments    ............... 1:10:50

1:10 .00 ************* he gave exmaple how to pass a subnet 

3) do we need to create the vpc first if we want to create our instance in the customized vpc?

ANS:
YES you wil need to need to hv a vpc that exists first but if ur nt using custom the it means ur using default and so u dnt need to passa any argument to ur resourec
trfrm wil place it in the defult vpc


1:26:41*****************   PASSING A KEY .............. a key need to associate with ur instance  ............... WATCH

first i need to lokk at my provider 
the provider is in us wwest2
i neeed to go to my aws console , sign in amd mk sure am in west2
i need to look at the key pairs i have in that region 
i look at my documentation, hw do i pass a key , i look at my arguments , scroll down to k
so always make sure you have that the key exists and the key is in ur env , for e.g in dis case, its west2

we will see how we can create our key using the ssh key gen command and u can create the private/public key on ur terminmal n dpass the key to terfrm n terfrm wil associate
that key wit ur instance bc u wil have both ur private key in ur env and it wil tk the public key and attach it to ur instance at ceration

                                        
1:354:00  .gitgnoire file for creating a secret
first i create the secret file and write the secret know only to me  e.g db_password = "landmark123"     terraform apply -var-file=secret.tfvars
but if am working with a team, ur working collaboratively, ur using .gitgnoire (inside  the .gitgnoire file, he refered to the secret file he wrote: secret.tfvars)
so am passing .gitnoir, if i push this code to you , u will not hv dis file the secret file, so u wont be able to see it
i creat my variable n mark it as sensitive = true so when trfrm create the statefile its nt going to output the value of d variable, it nt goin to be captured in d statefile 
as plain state , otherwiae anyone who has access to ur statefile are able to see ur secret
any thing u dnt wnat exposd, u mark it as senesitive n ter frm will nt expose it as an ouput or within ur statefile

                                  META ARGUMENTS   ............... REFer to note file in github
so far w ve been dealing with  Aruments are what we pass into our terrfm resource  when  we wnt to create a resourec or when we wnat to get data, uisng data source , w ecan 
use argument

META ARGUMENTS : these are arguments that alter the behaviour of a a resource , they dnt cahneg d resource they only change hw it behaves


INTERVIEW QUESTIONS  , WHta is meta arguments
meta arguments are what i pass into my terfrm resource to alter the behaviour  of hw the resource behaves

   ther are 5types
depends on
count
for_each
provider
lifecycle

your understanding of hw these wrk wil hekp u to easly wrk wit trefrm bc u can moduleize ur code otr create dependecies, u can reduce ur code to 
10lines of code bc u hv meta argument that can create resourecs jst based on the conditions that u pass


1) depends on:
trfrm has a feature of identifying resource dependency. this means that tfrm internally knws d sequence in wich d dependant resources needs to be craeted 
wheras the independent resources are created in parrallel.
ie if u have 2resources that are depndent on each other, terfrm internally has a way of identifying wich resource has to be created first b4 the other , 

depends_on meta-argument must be a list of refernces to other resources in the same calling resource.
 

   INTERVIEW QUESTIONS, 
What are implicit dependencies???

ANS:
THis is a situation wherby terfrm internally identifies d dependencies of resource n therfrore its able to identify which resource to create first, so it is abt dependencies
so if u dnt pass any depends on argument but tefrm still organizes which arguments needs to be created first then that becomes implicit depencies, its an inbuilt functionality
of tfrm that identifies which resource nids to be created first 


EXPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
this is whne u determine urself manaually the order resources are created 
this is done by apssing a depend_on meta argumentq


he showed an e.g,
in our caling resourec file/data block we have a resource for an instance, and a rsorec for a vpc 
terfrm plan and we see the plan is to first create the instance and then the vpc 
and then terraform apply: we see vpc creating and instance creating 
lets create a dependency
i want the vpc to depend on the instance, so that means the vpc can only be created after the instance has beeen craeted
so in my vpc i can say that this vpc depends on = the aws instance 
we pass it as a list bc we can put multiple arguments in there
depends on = [aws_instance.myec2]
can run terfrm format so it formats the code 
thne trfrm apply 
and we see its first goin to create the instance first
we dnt see any vpc creating as it did earlier
so have altered the behaviour
so after my instance have been created then it can then create the vpc 
this explicit , am defining hw i want my resources to be created
butb if i wanted my vpc to be created first then ill say my instance depends on ....

2) count 
it can be specified in resources as well as modules 
in trfrm a resource blk actually configures only one infrastructure obj by defaault.
if we want mutiple resources wit same configurations, w ecan define d count meta-argument  ie we can use count meta argument
this reduce the overhaeds of duplictaing the resource blk that number of times
ie with count meta-argument we can change tefrm hw the resourec wil behave 
e.g, so if i want to create 2instances, instaed of dupicating the resourec but i hv to change the name
these are too many lines of code to maintain  
so id rather introduce a meta argument and it will toveride the defaault
count = 3     ... that is it wil craete the resourec 3times 

***************but to be able to differentiate each of the created resource we pass a count.index , the index has to be whole numbers
the index ranges from 0 t0 -1
so if i want to create 3 instances 
count = 3
Name = "server-$(count.index)"
subsequently the instances wil be   ...................2:09:00
server-index1
server-index2
server-index3

the name that will be captUred in the statefile will have the index indicated
so we using the same code to create multiple instances 
the ami, user data, the instance type are all the same 

  ************************ LIMITATIONS OF COUNT ***************
bc count uses an index 
for e.g we created 4 instances and then i remove/ delete one instance from the list , count will try to reindex all the incidents instance and it wil delete all and then
recreate all again bc the index has to be frm 0 upwards.
also if go in the middle of the list and u remove an element frm a list then it means all the subsequent element needs to be resequenced
ie u removed index 2, so index 3, 4, 5 hv to be reconfigured to make the arrangment of the numbers accordingly
also count meta data cannot b used with for_each

so bc of that trfrm also has anoda argument called: 

3)    FOR EACH   ............... THIS is more flexible        ...............2:17
  this accepts a map or set of strings. tefrm wil create one instance of that resource for each member of that map or set. to identify each member of the for_each block,
we have 2objects:
eack key: the map or set member coresponding to each member
ecah value: the map value corressponding to each member.


e.g resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
for each = var.instance_type
ami           = data.aws_ami.amzlinux2.id
instance type = so instaed of this: var.instance_type     ***********we cahngeit to : each.value 
user_data    = file("${path.module}/app1-install.sh")          ie for each of the list (t2.micro", "t2.medium", "t3.micro) we wnt the instance typ to b for each
tag = {                                                               so for each one the instance type wil be the value 
   "Name" = "EC2Demo-${count.index)"
 }
}


varaiable "instance_type" {
    type = list(string)
    default = ["t2.micro", "t2.medium", "t3.micro"]

****************************************bt this wont work bc for each works with either a map or a set of strings 
run tefrm plan and we get an error : invalid for_each argument 

****************** so bc of this we can use a tefrm function to convert our list into a set of strings bc we cant convert to  amap bc we dnt hv key value pairs in here.

     CONVERTING LIST INTO SET OF STRING
we have a function called to set 
its used to convert a list or a map into a set 
 e.g
for each = toset(var.instance_type)
ami           = data.aws_ami.amzlinux2.id
instance type = each.value            ************** but if its a map : each.key , you supply the key then it wil return the value
user_data    = file("${path.module}/app1-install.sh")        
tag = {                                                           
   "Name" = "EC2Demo-${count.index)"

terrform plan 
and its successfull

so this how we use meta data for hw a resource behave or hw terfrm handles a resource.

2:29:00   ********************* but if its a map : each.key , you supply the key then it wil return the value of the key supplied.

4) provider     
specifies wich provider to use for a reosure. this is useful when u are using  multiple providers wich is usually used when u are creating multi-region resources.
for diffrrntiating those providers, u use an alias field.
the resource then reference the same alias field of the provider as provider.alias to tell wich one to use.
e.g when i wnt the use the europe region then in my resource i wil specify 

# default provider
provider google
  region = us-central

## Another provider
provider google
  alias = europe 
  region = europe-west1

## Referencing the other provider
resource "google_compute_instance" "example" {
  provider = google.europe                         .**********in my resourec i wil specify the provider

also another e.g
i hv a resource for an instance and a resource for a vpc 
if i want to creste the instance in us east1, then i v defined an alias below
then in the instance ill define my prorvider as aws.east
why bc i hv a vpc that wil be created in west
bt for the instance v pass a provider wit an alias that wil alter wher the resource wil be provisioned

resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
 provider = aws.east                     ************* here ill pass the provider
for each = toset(var.instance_type)
ami           = data.aws_ami.amzlinux2.id
instance type = each.value           
user_data    = file("${path.module}/app1-install.sh")        
tag = {                                                           
   "Name" = "EC2Demo-${count.index)"


varaiable "instance_type" {
    type = list(string)
    default = ["t2.micro", "t2.medium"]


resource "aws_vpc" "myec2" {
   cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
     depends_on = {aws_instance.myec2}


provider "aws" {
   alias = "east"
   region = "us-east-1"
}

    therfore , with this, your vpc wil be in US west bc i hv my provider, it wil tk the default provider 
but the instance will have an alias so wil be created in east 

*************2:39:10  ............... 
run terfrm plan 
we got error : invalid AMI, not found 
he said hes nt trying to troubleshoot, hes trying to establish why hes getting that error 
someone suggested that we calling resorces that was created in diff region,  west, to be created in east
so it doesnt recognize bc ami,ec2 are region specific thus the error

**************** he said
right now we are trying to create a resource in us east1,
we hv used a meta argumet wich alters the behavior , by default the resourdewil be craeted in d default region bt it wil also use thsis data ssource to get our AMI BT 
BC WE pass a provider, this data source is using d default provider to query that particular data. its trying to find data in us  west bt when it returns that particular
data, this AMI is nt found in us East1

2:44 :00 ************* so we need to find out can you pass a provider alias in a data source????
can somebody go to the provider and find out
so this is your first project at work so how can you pass it?? 

ANS:............   2:50:00
she saw it under meta data sources
data sources
aws_regions

that we should use :
bc the documentation says, it enables all the region so that u check for the resources across regions
so in the data source , he added:

data  "aws_region" "current" {
  all_regions = true

   terrafrm apply but we still get error 
prof said:
we are tryin g to call a data source bt how are we referencing it, passing it ?    ............2:53:05

ANS:
in the data source,where we have our resource to get our AMI , he added provider = aws.east
data "aws_ami" amzlinux2" {
    provider = aws.east
    most_recent = true
    owners =   ["amazon"]
    filter {

terrafrm plan ...... successful   ********************* this is the solution 
but terfrm apply and vpc not specified errror
this is bc in us East(where i want my reources to be configured, i dont have a default vpc 
thi s is jst a basic question to see how we use meta arguments wich alters the default behaiour of our resource
the default behaviour of this data source is that it will use the default provider which is us west2
bt bc v congigure an alias, i wnat my resources to be configured in a diff region us East, therfroe we v to manipulitae d data source to use d same provider as our resources
so, data source has to go to into us East bt unfortunataely we dnt hv a default vpc in US East 
************* so the rectify the issue he changed our alias region to a region that has a default vpc
in the provider he chnaged the providr alias to US west, region = west-1
in the data source for instance he cahnged the provider to aws.west
in the data source for AMI, he changed provider to aws.west

terffrm plan 
terfrm apply .............. successfull.................. 2:57:13
vpc was created in oregon west2 but the instances were craeted in california , west1

so we hv seen hw we can use provider as a meta argument to manipulate hw our resources are provisioned created.
tru troubleshooting n finding errorrs , this hw u cm to findout hw things work.  if u find errors like that dnt freakout, just understnad d concept.
the basic concept is that AMIs are region specific
*************if tefrm gives u an error thta an AMI is not found , jst knw that ur are in the wrong region.
###############################if ur usin a data osurce, a datasource shud always return ur AMI , and a datasource  wil use d provider, the region of the provider that is the 
default region that your datasource wil try to query the data from , bt if u hv used an alis , if one of ur resource has an alias then ur datasource wil always try to query
data frm ur defult region that is set in ur default provider bt if u ve an alias, uv configured a provider alias then u hv to pass that in your datasource so that ur 
specifying the region ur datasource shud query or get the data.

5)  LIFE CYCLE
   A life cycle defines the life cycle of a resource. as per the resource behaviour , tefrm can do the following:
create a resource destroy a resource updated resource in place update resource by deleting existing and create new.
lifecycle is a nested block unde rresource that is used to cutomise that behaviour 

   CUSTOMIZATION THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER LIFE CYCLE BLOCK
A) Create_before_destroy :(Type: Bool)  ... u pass it as a bullion ,, the default nature of trfrm is that it wil destroy a resource then create bt in prod if u dnt wnat 
that to happen, u dnt wnat downtime , u wnt u infrasture to be created first then you can protect ur infrastu using life cycle meta argument
you can pass create_before_destroy = true 
b) prevent_destroy: (Type:Bool)
c) ignore_changes (type list (Attribute Name)

******************** 3.06:05
if we ar to chnage our instanec frm t2 micro to t2 medium,
we knw that when u chnage your instance type or AMI , its like your opearting system , wich maps ur cpu n memeory,that particular instance wil hv to be destroyed, tefrm 
cannot just update but 
if its tag, if i change it, trfrm  can modify it , if i run the plan , iil seee trfrm wil try to modify it in place, memaing its updated frm this to this , it doesnt hv
to destroy the instance

but if  we ar to chnage our instanec frm t2 micro to t2 medium, and run trfrm plan,
we see plan : 1 to add , 1 to destroy
trfem apply 
then we see it first starts to dsetroy and at the same time, its creating
but we dnt wnat hsi to hpapen in prod  bc ur imnfrasture is been destroy n bc of that downtime

*******************  3:10:00
A) to prevent thsi in our resource block u can pass a life cycle meta argument

life cycle{
  create_before_destroy = true

trfrm apply 
it showed destroying
creating 
then destroying multiple times 
and finlayy it took 1sec to destroy and 4ms to create 
so he said technically thats still a downtime 

************* but at the end of the class,  agirl showe has and it showed created 31sec b4 destroy 43sec
and prof said yes thats hw its suppose to wrk bt his system has jsut been acting up 


B:
life cycle{
  prevent_destroy = true

trfrm apply 
error: ccannot be destroy , says its protected by a life cycle
so it altered the default bebaviour of the instance 

but the documentation says u can bypass that plan by using -target
terrefrm destroy -target 
so i can target the specific resource i wnat to destroy

when we run tereraform state list 
we see we no longer have the targeted resourec 

C)
YOU can play around and see hw it works


  that is the main, when u understnad how this meta arguments works then trefrm wil become very easy bc when when we start writing code n we using functions ,
we usidng meta argment like e.g for each", we are able to loop over code , we are able to careet multiple resources with few lines of code
if i have few lines of code that code is easy to read and miantain , u are less prone to mk errors bc u hv very few lines of code 
instaed of me writing a 100 lines of code to deploy 10 ec2 instances, i can write 10 line sof code using  meta arguments , using loops n the code can easily be read, it
easy to maintain and less prone to errors.


what we left for u to know is terfrm backend 
what we ve ben doing, as we v been writibg and genetaing codes, trfrm has been storing our state file
this is the stae of our infrasture , it stores this state file in ur pwd 
this is cllaed a localbackend
a backend is wHer terfm opretaons hv been happening
and trerm has been downloading our providers here and its stores its state file in ur pwd , wher ur runing trem and it also has a backup of ur statfile inaces ue 
mainstate file gets corrupted bt thsis state file are in ur pwd , 
so this is calle da loacl backend , so sofar we v ben using a local backend

   INTERVIEW QUESTION
what are the type of trfrm backend that u are familair with ? 
NOW we knw what a loscal backend is ..............

when we meet nxt we will see what a remote backend is 
we will create an s3 bucket and be able to push our trfrm statefile to  the bucket
so we will use an s3 bucket a sa remote storage, so it will be consider more like a remote bcakend bc trfrm wil nt read its statefile frm here
when we run tefrm init, it wil initialize the s3 bucket as its backend 
so thats what we will call it , a remote backend for state storsge 
and we ll see hw we can secure the s3 busket using diamond or db table as part of our security
bc when ur collaborating with ur  team member,  the statefile neds to b accesible ,evry team mmeber  neds to hv acces to the state file bc ur working on the same 
infratsure 
so thsi statefile nedst to be in a place wher we can collobrate  bt we dnt push our statefile in github or repository
it needs to b in a secured env and thats why we  aer goin to b usin an s3 bucket

on monday we ll see hw we can use an s3 bucket to store our statefile an dnt jsut taht
the trfr we v been running, we v been uisng trfrm as an open source
trfrm in our local env bt we ll also see we hv whats called trfrm cloud
its more for entrprise bt u can sign up an account, u can hv an account in eneterprise cloud and 
for rnterprise cloud trfrm operations wil b happing in the trfrm cloud, u ll caete a respo and trfem is able to monitor ur repo 
or ur able to isseu trefrm commands in in ur local env bt what is happening , trfrm build evertin in terfrm cloud


but for now jst go tru ur  meta argument ,data sources ,  and be comfortable in manipulating data 
and the exrecise we did today,  atleat it shud hv solididfied ur understanding of how data sourecs works and hw the provider meta araument works
the bottem lin eis is jsut undersatnd the concept of h weverytin works 


        QUETSION 
1) The diff btw count meta n for each,i noticed that thers an index in the count bt aside frm that is der any othr diff?? Cos it seems they do d same tin, multiple resources
 ANS:
once we start doing loops which i think i can show u guys on monday, u will see the major dif f
whenu use count, it wrks on alist bc list, if u knw what is called data type, u can v a list n u can hv a map, a set , all these are data types
 so if u are using count, if its reading frm a list, what will happening is it sequences values frm a lsit whic is 0index , so frm 0, 1,2, 3,4,5
bt the problem with count i sthat if u cm an remove a valaue frm the middle of the list , which according to count as it sequence, it was suppose 2 b at index1, bt if i 
remove that value frm d middle of the lsit , what happens is that is going to shift the resource at index2 it moves it to bcome index 1, trfrm does that by destroying d 
resource that was in index2 so that it shifs it to 1 bc list cnat hv a gap inbetween (it has to run frm 0 to whatever)so thats the downside of count  bt if u remove a value
 frm the top of the list the last eelemt, it wil stil wrk fine bc ur nt modifying anytin frm 0 , d problem is if anytin is taken frm d middle 

thats why for each now becomes more superior bc for each uses a set or a map , so lng as u can convert ur list into a set , then a set is nt index, values in a set are nt
indexed like frm 0123, values ina set as a data type are refrernced by the name , so if i remove the name fmr the midlde of the list ist only gon tp affect the resource 
taht has that name bc we are using keys, we are using names, we ar nt using index

2) for each , can we create two,  t2 medium  bc the example we used, we actually t2 micro, t2 medium 

ANS:
bc as longs it reads frm the list right??

*********he tried to practicalise it bt his system was nt working


3) if we used a life cycle to prevent the instance not to be deledte bt if the instance was in that particular vpc , can we delete the vpc

ANS: 
NO U CAN NEVER DELETE A VPC THAT HAS A RESOUREC IN IT 
if a vpc has a resoure, it cannot be deleted, if u try to delete it it gives u an error 











bt once we go into bootcamp, we start to give you more advanced form of trfm
for now this is jsudt the basics
