***** session with engr armstrong , think he was helping me troubleshoot tomcat 

          WHY DO WE START TOMCAT BUT NOT MAVEN 

We start tomcat because its a software that is accessible in the internet/browser and it has to be accessible because customers need to utilize the apps in tomcat server
but maven is a build tool, nothing is coming in or going out , maven doesnt listen to/on any port . it can do builds, change codes from machine readable to human readable
maven is not accessible on the internet , it uses just port 22and our server is ready to build.

we also access sonar qube, jenkins on the internet/browser because people need to see that ecerything that is required for the code is successful
