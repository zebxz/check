devops can be used to automate IT tasks and processes

    vs     jenkins 1.08
Landmark Devops masterclass graduate:
i have 7years experience implementing devops processes and automating tasks for multiple clients
i have experience in implememnting devops processes and automaitng tasks for multiple clients


******* devops brings automation therefore, devops is all about automation because on a daily basis we are trying to automate it tasks and process .
what we have automated we are asking are there better automation options 
e.g, if our current automation takes 10hours, our question eveyday is can we automate better to reduce the time from 10 to 2hours



WHAT IS DEVOPS TO YOU   .. ?
Based on my experience devops is all abt continous automation and improvement on how IT tasks and processes are implemented

WHY devops ?
1) continous Automation -:
Devops brings automation, continous and thats why we choose devops in our env. We choose devops not agile or waterfall or a combination of Agile 
and devops bc devops brings continous automation

2) Continous transformation: 
transforming how things are done 

3) Disruption:
changing how task were done in the past , disrupt processes that were done using traditional approasch , bring in automation 
4)its all about innovation and change


     DEVOPS IMPORTANCE?
its the present and the future of IT innovation (and change) The way devops is devops is designed and implementated is whats needed today which is the present and thats what
will be needed tommorrow meaning devops is the future bc it brings continous automation 


   WHAT IS YOUR TASK AS A DEVOPS ENGINEER ?

 ******* From bootcamp Dec26 

CHRIS  said he was using jenkins to do a build but was always having a fail

proff:
    if theres a problem ,you dnt just first dive into your pom.xml file
the first thing is to check the logs, if we are building in jenkins, thats what we call console output 
u go to the console output and try to identify what cud be the cause of the problem, if the cause of the problem will need that i get into pom.xml to check then il do that 
if the cause is for you to talk to dvelopers to inform them to check their code , it cannot run bc the compilers they hv defined is the wrong compilers they shud check
their pluggins , the pluggins defined in pom.xml are not the pluggins the job neeeds to run , so they shud wrk on it and define the correct pluggins , 
so if theres a problem check the logs 



58:00
    Thank you for this question

in my env i am incharge of manging artifacts , and as part of my job, i set up my nexus artifactory  by creating a nexus serevr, ensuring that nexus is fully installed, 
ensure thats its running as expected, i create artifactories, repositories in nexus n i use the artifcatory  repository url to modify my project file which is pom.xml,
this wil permit us to upload artifacts into this artifcatories, when we build frm the development branch, artifacts are uploaded into the nexus releases repository .. 59:00
when we build form the master or the relaese branch, artifacts are uploaded into the release repository
i was tasked to upload some artifacts into the release repository and i realised for some reason i kept getting build fail and when i checked the logs i realised i was using 
the wrong version in my pom.xml, instaed of ensuring that the versioning is tagged to releases it was tagged to snapshot, so i quickly went to my pom.xml modified the version
used the corret version which was snapshot and once i had to rebuld again via my pipeline that failure never existed because it was now uploading artifacts into the snapshot
repository that was expected.

  INTERVIEW QUESTION
What is the diff btw bin and sbin directory in linux ??
SBIN: are system binary files only executable by users with adminstrative or elevated priviledges or admin/root user
eg adduser , chage

                              WHILE
BIN : Binary fiLes executable by any user (normal user& admin user)
eg ls, pwd, cd, touch

****33;50
          ###########what is configuration file ??
  configuration files (commonly known simply as config files) are files used to configure the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs or applications, 
server processes and operating system settings.



LINUX 3A & 3B  was linux commands etc
                                         

HOME; contains users' home directory details 

etc : contains configuration files
/etc/shadow = detail information about users passwd
/etc/passwd = detail inf abt users                         ****** contains file of all users
/etc/ssh/sshd_config = ssh configuration details


 RESOURCE ULTILIZATION
sOft link is more resource efficient bc it uses minimal resources of our system 
soft link points to our original file/doc but hard link is a copy of the file 
while the original file is deleted, we cannot access the original link frm the soft link bc its a symbol to the file but we can access the original file form the hard copy
bc its a copy of the original file 

IQ;  WHAT IS SOFT IINK & HARD LINK?
  CREATIG SHORTCUT /LINK TO FILES
Hard link : copy of a file (hard link starts with '_') just like a normal file 
ln fieName linkName
ln list.txt my list
hardlink maintains original file size  eg if original file size is 250, hardlink will also be 250


softlink: symbolic to the file ) short cut link to the file
ln-s filename linkname
ln -s new.txt mylist
*** soft link starts with  l & the file size is smaller compared to the original file 
eg, original file can be 250mb in size but softlink can be 5mb in size


 online
To remove a directory using the rm command in Linux, follow these steps:
1) rmdir dirname           :  to delete an empty dir 
2) rm:                     :  to delete empty and non-empty directories
  a) rm -r dirname         :  If a directory or a file within the directory is write-protected, you will be prompted to confirm the deletion
  b) rm -rf                :  To remove a directory without being prompted
  c) rm -r dir1 dir2 dir3  :   To remove multiple directories at once, with a prompt to confirm
  d) rm -rI dir1           :  To remove multiple directories without a prompt
  e) rm -rv directory_name :  To see a list of deleted files

  PACKAGE MGT

Package managers come in two main categories: dependency managers and operating system package managers.
 1)Dependency managers, like Maven, npm, and Gradle, handle project-specific dependencies and their versions for programming languages and frameworks.
2)Operating system package managers, such as apt, yum,& Homebrew, manage software and system packages for specific operating systems. eg Linux, MAcOs, Windows

(System packages are collections of software, documentation, and configuration files that are bundled together to make it easier to install, manage, and utilize a specific software program
or application. Examples include software suites like Microsoft Office, which includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Other examples include web browsers like Chrome, and Firefox, and 
operating systems like Windows.)

 How to install, updates and remove packages in redhat linux 

************ y is only associated with package command , it doesnt apply to any other process or command 

USING PACKAGE MANAGERS
sudo yum insatll, wget -y  -- to install
sudo yum remove wget -y    ---  to delete
 sudo yum install httpd -y
apt install packageName- debian/ubuntu systems
brew install packageName - Mac - APPLe systems
choco install packageName - windows systems
yum install packageName - good for redhat/contos systems


wget helps to download (software appl/packages)but 
package managers download and install sofware & system packages

webget: wget is a non-interactive netwrk downloaader used to download (software)packages

SCRIPTING 1&2
My question : what is hard coding and soft coding???


  QUESTION   1:45:22

you were explaning abt the go goland, the powershell, talking abt the xml, i just want to know do they really perform the same function or diff functions 

ANS:
Not actually the same function , but u may want to write a script to deploy appl and you choose to write it in go or goland language , or you write in bash shell scripting 
or the language your are versatile in or the lanuguage used in your project
so you work in landmark , which language are you goin to hv a mastery of it goin to be based on the language we use in our own project 


 


1:46:38

WE Hv seen how we can run this scripts by manually typing the commands to execute them 
so my quetson is are we still goin to to go tru how we can automate this scripts automatically , ie mayb ur system restarts and the script starts automatically 

ANS;

yes, we are goin to look at some of those things how we can achieve automation in scripting  using a cron table , not even your that your system start , thats just one thing
i can decide that my server all the data base  shud backup at midnight , how do you do that , you use a cron table 
u write a script that will backup all your data bases at midnight

thats why in devops engrs can hv multiple jobs bc they can give you a ticket thats a repeating action , u write a script taht can run that job ,so u just always checck the 
logs to ensure script is running as expected


 
SCRIPT 3&4

IQ: Explain your experience in shell scripting  ?
1. using bash shell scripts for userMGT. 100% [New Graduate]    
2. In my environment/company/Landmark i use scripting for userMGT for over 5 years. 


IQ: What is the significance of $? in scripting.
  It gives the status of your last run command.
  The value can be = 0 [Its okay]   or 
  The value can be = 1-127 [Its not okay]   

IQ
What is the significance of $$ in linux

ANS:
This represents the process ID of the last command because whatever w edo in linux there is a process ID created for it

GIT1
Interview Questions
As a DevOps Engineer, what are your roles & responsilities
    in Versioning with Git?

meee... i ensure the proper installation of softwares and proper security in our work environment
Answer:
   our main task is project onboarding
  1. We ensure that Developers environments are configured and secured 
     We create an enabling environment for Developers to code/Develop ( to get to work)
       and that includes: setting up DevelopmentServers are created in AWS/GCP.  
       share login details with Developers/Team [ userName/password ]   ( so they can connect and get to work)
       Ensure that git package/Software is installed 



      GIT 2
what is  GIT PULL/CLONE
Git pull: pulls changes to your local environment
git clone: downloads a version of the entire development work to your local environment

GIT4 IQ: wHAT IS PR 
peer review or pull reQ
1:05:50 In our environment, it also severs as a branch security, ie all commit in the master branch must go through PR 

 IQ: How many branches are you supporting in your projects?
    Branches are used to create lines of development in git. 
    A branch is a line of development 
 In our environment in landmark , We maintain / support a minimun of 3 branches:
        development branch ,staging branch, master branch  

command for global configuration? ... 24;10
 git config -- global usre.email "your email address'
                            git config  --- global user.name "yourname"

52;42     What is PAT?
Personal access token
it defines the scope/limits/restriction of what each member can do  


DIFF BTW GIT PULL & GIT FETCH,
  git fetch --> It brings changes in the code to the LocalRepo   *** 2:10:00 ( this requires a review before merging) , MOSTLY recommended
  git pull --> It brings changes in the code to the localRepo and & Working area    ( this merges without a review)


STUDENT QUESTION 
are we going to be pushing and deploying these codes , also developers are going to be using diff terminals or if they are already using github wil they be obligated to use gitbash bc its a by product of github
ANS;
gitbash is a git terminal that can be uased to preocess git processes frm end to end & run git commands, to install git inur env is to install gitbash
if ur using windows u can use a package manager to install git like yum or apt for ubuntu
we are trying to manage tasks as if we are developers, trying to perform the functions of developers
now what will developers be doing & what wil devops engr do at work?
developers wil be using git for version to write code, using github to push their code for collabortaion
however, as devops engr, most of our work will be on git bc we will be cretaing stufffs like teams & adding memebers, creating repositories when we hv a project, & if need be creating organisations.
that is the work of devops engr, we are nt going to be writing codes, but there are other kinds of codes which we are goin to be writing which we will see eventually
they wnt be hard core coding, its going to be more of like diff scripting languages like bash shell , we hv a git hub repository with a lot of bash shell which you can just modify.
and when we fet to k8, we are going to do k8 manifest files, writing files that are used to deploy app in k8
when we get to docker we will write docker files, when we get to ansible we will write ansible play books, those play books will be committe dto our github account



                                   GIT 4
***1:42;00    IDE 
integrated development environment ( are sofwares that eases code writing)


resolving conflict
we resolve merge conflict by merging manually (ie GIT4;  git diff (dev or stage) to see the changes then vi into the file & delete the conflict ie (the errors>>> & its lines)
however avoid merge conflict for best practices ( I bliv this will mean working in the dev branch then you 

IQ: 
how can we merge a particular commit among many commits
Git cherry - pick commitID ..... good for merging a particular commit among many commits
LOL *** me ... in the master branch using using the git merge and the commit id

HOW TO MERGE CHANGES IN GIT
 git merge
git cherry pick
git rebase


IQ:
What is the difference between Git & Github:
Git is an open source Distributed Version Control System(DVCS) which records
changes made to files (codes) laying emphasis on speed, data integrity in a
distributed non-linear workflows.  
GitHub is a source code management[SCM] tool


IQ  
Explain your branching strategy in LandmakTechnology ?? 


1. Number of branches = WE maintain 3 branches
  dev branch    ---> develoment Environment
  stage branch  ---> Testing/QA/UAT Environment
  master branch ---> PRODUCTION 
    feature 
    bug_fixed



2. Branch security = 
   All commits in the master branch must go through PR 

we also have branch security in our branching strategy 
our branch security is such that no one can commit directly to the master branch, all commit in the master branch must go through  PR (pair review) or there must be a pull
request

3. Switching branches =  working tree should be clean 
    DevOps Engineer [dev branch / master--bugfixed]
    If neccesary backup incomplete tasks before switching  
      git stash command, do not commit yet because your task is incomplete at the momemt



 *** 1;45:59 PUBLIC KEY & PRIVATE KEY
  The private key is authenticated against the public
the public is like the key while the private is the lock
you slot the key in the lock & you have access



1:27;26 ***********   DIFF BTW GUI & COMMAND LINE
e.g  when i go into github and create a branch, i am using GUI tool bc am creating it directly from my console
i can also create the branch directly from my command line


****** the PAT prevents unauthorized users from cloning our projects
it can prevent unauthorized access bc you can deceide what the PAT can and cant do 
eg can clone public or private repository/modify/push code
with PAT you can determine the scope of what can be done 
eg
i can create and assign a PAT to a personnal user as well as define the scope for which it can be used for.

in the past password was used but that will grant everyone full admin access, thats why they removed passwd support to PAT so that access can be defined, the scope can be 
restrited
