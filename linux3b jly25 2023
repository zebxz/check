    TASK carried  out on a cOMPUTER

1) FILE MGT     (directories are in blue while files are in white)
2) user mgt

ii)file mgt related maintenance commands    (commands for managing files)
touch  fiename = creates an empty file 
cat filename = read the file content 
echo = print results of command   ( prints the output content of what is typed
echo  (>) to redirect output into a file & replace the file content

ec2-user@demo~ ] $ echo ' i am a rich ' > devops
the output is redirected into an existing file or a newly created file and replaces the file content
***** can echo create files = YES in this case  (devops ) was created

Adding content to file with echo: the output is appended (>>) into a file and add to the content

can be used to modify, create and add contents to files

- Vi FileName:  this is a file editor used to create and/or modify files and also to add content to files
eg ec2-user@demo ~ ] vi list

you start accessing the file in command mode
in command mode we cant modify content
press the 'i'key to enter "insert" mode
press "esc key" to enter command mode


2) save and quit 
1) press 'esc key' to enter command mode

((((( to read content : cat, less, more, tail, head.



       Read the content of a file:
cat fileName:  Read /display file content
cat -n fileName : list content of a file 
head fileName ; display the 1st 10 lines
head -3 fileName: : Display the 1st 3lines
head -1 fileName : display the 1st file line 
tail file name : display the last 10 lines              the press 'q' to leave
less fileName : you can go back and fort pages in a file with many pages
more file name: to read page by page


    READ THE INFO OF USERS
cat/etc/password = all the users detail in our server
tail etc/passwd  = users recently created 
tail -3/etc/passwd = -3 last user


     FILE BACKUP
CP = creates another copy of your file
cp = filename new filename 


      Renaming files /directories 
mv filename  new filename
mv dirname   new dirname


      Relocating file / directories
mv file to be maoved New locataion (file dir) 
eg we have a file in one  home/ec2-usere  (in our present working dir) but once its moved we cant find it in ls again
ie it lists the content of our pwd



              Deleting file (with or without content)
rm filename


**********                      counting line and character in a file 
wc fileanme = in the order of lines/words/character

wc -i = no. of lines
wc -c = no. of character
wc -w = no. of words


                  RESOURCE ULTILIZATION
sOft link is more resource efficient bc it uses minimal resources of our system 
soft link points to our original file/doc but hard link is a copy of the file 

while the original file is deleted, we cannot access the original link frm the soft link bc its a symbol to the file but we can access the original file form the hard copy
bc its a copy of the original file 


   CREATIG SHORTCUT /LINK TO FILES
Hard link : copy of a file (hard link starts with '_') just like a normal file 
ln fieName linkName
ln list.txt my list
hardlink maintains original file size  eg if original file size is 250, hardlink will also be 250


softlink: symbolic to the file ) short cut link to the file
ln-s filename linkname
ln -s new.txt mylist
*** soft link starts with  l & the file size is smaller compared to the original file 
eg, original file can be 250mb in size but softlink can be 5mb in size


                     HIDDEN FILES
FIles that start with .
ls- a = to list hidden files


                  LONG list
ll -t  : lists files from last created to the file that was created first     (based on the time file was created)
ls -l  : lists files in alphabectical order    (sort)
ls -ltr  : list files based on reverse order (file created first on top will be created last below)
reverses the time file was created
ll   : long list
