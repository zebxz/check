LANDMARK  DEVOPS E. DEgree master class syllabus: 
 for everyone to becomae a master and to master the subject matter in Devops end to end automation and deployment.

   AFTER Devops training you are expected to become 
1)SME = subject matter expert
it means that you have - Technical skill - understanding all the devops modules
2) mangerial skill - Project mangers (mange projects, members in your team) - scrum master
3) leadership skills - can be a team lead
SRE : site reliability engineering
DevSecops : Devops dev security and operations 
   SRE/DevSecops
Devops/cloud/Application Engineering
platform/kubernetes/application Engineering/ infrastructure engineering


DEVOPS INTRO:
we are devops engr , we are subject matter experts 

Applications are the output from software

Anything done in linux is a process 

***** Git4  ... 15.26 
the recommendation is to write good commit messages

we support java based applictaion/projects in our environment


Anytime we change anything tin in configurtaion file we restart the server


Sonar Q&A
we cant do without CLI bc commands bring automation thats why you hv so much money thrown at you  and its not in all cases that we can  use only GUI

what is sshd  ???
i knw we need a service smt when we are connecting to server and you always say ssh , pls what ais ssh to a layman  ?????????
..... i think it means we connect



******************************************************************

 WHAT KIND OF COMPUTER ARE YOU USING ??
The type of computer one is using can depend on the vendor
eg : i can say am using a dell computer but its running a windows system so am using a windows computer

therfore, what makes a computer isnt just about the hardware or vendor but mostly about the operating system running the computer
the heart of the computer is the operating system

An HP with windows operating system = windows system 
A dell laptop with linux operating system = linux systems
An HP laptop with linux operating system = linux system


*************************************************************

EXPLAIN YOUR EXPERIENCE IN DEVOPS? 
The 20 modules for this course is your experience in devops (about 20 minutes)

        ANS:
BSc /MSc graduate IT 
devops can be used to automate IT tasks and processes

    vs     jenkins 1.08
Landmark Devops masterclass graduate:
i have 7years experience implementing devops processes and automating tasks for multiple clients
i have experience in implememnting devops processes and automaitng tasks for multiple clients


******* devops brings automation therefore, devops is all about automation because on a daily basis we are trying to automate it tasks and process .
what we have automated we are asking are there
better automation options 
e.g, if our current automation takes 10hours, our question eveyday is can we automate better to reduce the time from 10 to 2hours

WHAT IS DEVOPS TO YOU   .. ?
Based on my experience devops is all abt continous automation and improvement on how IT tasks and processes are implemented

WHY devops ?
1) continous Automation -:
Devops brings automation, continous and thats why we choose devops in our env. We choose devops not agile or waterfall or a combination of Agile 
and devops bc devops brings continous automation

2) Continous transformation: 
transforming how things are done 

3) Disruption:
changing how task were done in the past , disrupt processes that were done using traditional approasch , bring in automation 
4)its all about innovation and change


     DEVOPS IMPORTANCE?
its the present and the future of IT innovation (and change) The way devops is devops is designed and implementated is whats needed today which is the present and thats what
will be needed tommorrow meaning devops is the future bc it brings continous automation 





IQ:  Examples of automated task 
Explain your experience in bash shell scripting


Explain your experience with linux system
i have over 7years experience performing various tasks on linux system including:
file mgt, user mgt, process mgt, security mgt, package mgt, service mgt system mgt , minitoring mgt, db backup

1) Deploying, provisioning and creating linux servers in Aws cloud and connecting to servers using - ssh protocol
2) configuring , optimising , commissioning (installing packages) and decommissioning (uninstalling packages)and securing linux servers
3) Running workloads in linux servers/systems using:
GUI - console
command - CLI
scripts - 


EXamples of workoads/task executed

file mgt: touch , vi, echo, ls, u mask, chmod, mkdir, chown
user mgt: adduser, usermod, useradd, change
process mgt ; top, ps-ef, jobs, kill,bg, fg
security mgt;  passwd, selinux, firwall (to secure our sever)
package mgt ; wget, yum/apt, rpm, (redhat package manager)
serveice mgt ;  systemctl, start/stop/enable/status
system mgt ;
monitoring = df -h, free -m


4)scheduling and automating task using cron tables
a) backup all data bases every midnight
b) deploying the latest version of the app every sunday at midnight
C) optimize our appservers every month on the 20th  day at midnight (yum update -y & $ yum upgrade -y)
d)monitor system responses and send alerts using the threshold everyminute if cpu/mem usage exceed 80% send email df - h = cpu


Archive/Data backup commands

     WHAT IS YOUR TASK AS A DEVOPS ENGINEER ?
As a devops engineer, i work with my team to develop, test, build, review + qualify , secure, deploy , access, maintain and monitor applications using computerized 
automated automated technologies In our technology stack we are able to run/ execute task using either GUI or CLI 

These are my tasks as a devops engineer
Develop applications
Test application 
Build applications
REview + Qualify applications
Secure applications
Deploy applications
Make applications accessible
Maintain applications
Manage and monitor applications using computerized automated technologies 
Technology stack



What is your Technology stack in landmark Technologies  ?/??
   in other words, what are the tools that are in your tool box?
These tools are what we can call the modules for this class

                                                           SCRIPTING



Automating IT processes/workloads with GUI/CLI and Scripting
=============================================================                  (CLI is part of scripting)  
Automating IT:
   processes
   workloads 
   jobs    
   tasks  

****** with the help of scripting creating user is very simple

We need computer systems to carryout tasks:
===========================================
Computer/systems:
  1. Bare Metal / HardWare components 
      RAM - memory 
      Cpu 
      ROM - hard disk / volume / storage 
      MOUSE
      KEYBOARD
      Screen
  2. Software components 
      operating system = OS [This is the heart a computer] : 
        Windows OS [ 7/xp/8/9/10/11 ]
        MacOS 
        Solaris  
        Linux  OS: distributors
          Radhat 6/7/8/9 / 
          ubuntu  [16/18/20/22] / 
          centos 6/7/8/9 / 
          debain / amazon Linux / suse / etc.  
      and
      other softwares :
         shell 
         Sublime text
         mobaXterm / gitbash / telegram /    
         Microsoft word/Excell  




Examples of workloads:
  fileMGT :mg8 file
 userMGT: mange users
 packageMGT: manage the packages given to my system
 securityMGT : ensures my system is secure
 systemMGT : ensures the system is functioning very well
 etc.



******* for us to be able to achieve this workload and more what do we need 
for our workload to be deployed to production, workload mgt on computing systems 


Workload management on Computer systems [LINUX OS] :
    GUI: = Graphical user interface  -- 5%
    CLI: = command line interface    -- 
            aws ec2 describe-instances  
     Linux OS = Linux servers/systems
      ls:   = list the content of a directory
      touch test.txt



BUT NOW WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT SCRIPTING 
    scripts: a shell-script is a collection of one or more commands in a file 
             a script is a file containing commands  
    write a simple script that welcomes Engineers to work?
