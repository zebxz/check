FIELDS FOR FILES, FILE PERMISSION/SECURITY, HOW TO CALCULATE /DETERMINE PERMISSION FOR FILES, FILE MGT COMMANDS ( sudo, chown, chgrp, )  GREP COMMANDS ,



                    FIELDS FOR FILES
1) FILE TYPE: its either :- File, d= directory, l= soft link, - = hardlink


2) permissions (file security/permission) : (owner = rwx, group = r-x, others = r-x  
rw- r--r = read write & read 
rwx rwx rwx= read write execute 
these permission are given to owners of the file, the group that owns the files & to any other person 

eg               (       permission    )
  file type     owner    group    others    no. of links       owner     grp owner     size         filename
a)    -        rw-       r--        r--          1           ec2-user    ec2-user      250         class-txt
b)   d         rwx       r-x        r-x          3           ec2-user     ec2-user     25              dev


3) number of links: eg 1,3,3,2

4) owner eg (ec2-user)
5) group owner eg(engineers) meaning the ec2-user is one of the engineers
6) size of the file in bytes
7) date and time of creation  eg May 4 23:27
8) file Name /dir Name 

in security a file we need to determine who acn have access to the file:
either the owner
the group owners
other (any other person)


********** what type of access can they have :  Acess levels
1) Read: read the file         = r = 4
2) write: To modify the file   = w = 2
3) execute: for ther purposes  = x =1



HOW TO CALCULATE /DETERMINE PERMISSION  FOR FILES

  
File security / Permissions:
============================
Who can access a file?
  owner   
  groupOwners   
  others
Access levels:        
  read    = r = 4   
  write   = w = 2
  execute = x = 1 

  owner group  others
- rw-   r--    r--.    1 ec2-user ec2-user  class.txt
d rwx   r-x    r-x.    3 ec2-user ec2-user  dev

           owner  group  others   default Permissions
class.txt  rw-=6  r--=4  r--=4      0644    
dev        rwx=7  r-x=5  r-x=5      0755

Ie
class.txt  rw-= (4+2)6  r--=4         r--=4      0644    
dev        rwx= (4+2+1)7  r-x=(4+1)5       r-x=5      0755


   
                            HOW TO CALCULATE /DETERMINE PERMISSION  FOR FILES


                   PERMISSION FOR NORMAL USER

The default Permissions assign to files depends on;
The class of the user[normal user or rootUser]
                      normal user    rootUser:
                      file   dir     file   dir                 for file
Full Permissions      0666   0777    0666   0777     (owner =rw=6, group=rw=6, others=rw=6)
default Permissions   0644   0755    0644   0755
                      ----   ----    ----   ----
 umask                0022   0022    0022   0022    :
                      ----   ----    ----   ----

******* full permission means anyone that has access to the file can read,& modify the file


IQ: What is the umask value for a normal user and the rootUser?
IQ: What is the umask value?
    It is used to define file/dir Permissions at creation.  

            normal user        rootUser
            file     dir       file     dir  
 owner   = rw-=6    rwx=7      rw-=6    rwx=7   
 group   = rw-=6    rwx=7      r--=4    r-x=5
 others  = rw-=6    rwx=7      r--=4    r-x=5  



PERMISSON FOR ROOT USER:
   ( i bliv the root user always has the default permission)

switch to the rootUser:
  sudo su - or 
  sudo -i  
Make a file

d rwx r-x r-x. 2 root root 6 May  4 23:45 billionaire
- rw- r-- r--. 1 root root 0 May  4 23:45 rich.me

 rootUser
        file     dir  
       rw-=6    rwx=7   
       r--=4    r-x=5
       r--=4    r-x=5  

****** when a mask value is set, it is used to determine the type of permission the file will have 

1)
IQ:Create a umask value that will assign full Permissions 
   to files CREATED by the ec2-user 
ANS: our default permission becomes full permission

                      normal user    rootUser:
                      file   dir     file   dir
Full Permissions      0666   0777    0666   0777
default Permissions   0666   0777    0644   0755
                      ----   ----    ----   ----
 umask                0000   0000    0022   0022    :
                      ----   ----    ----   ----

******** i bliv the default permission for the normal user has to be set to full permission
to set the unmask value= umask 0000


**************     
2)
IQ:Create a umask value that will assign 0600 Permissions to files CREATED by the ec2-user 
   *********   the unmask value is the permission we wnat to set that the files will hv at creation ie we want to set the permission the file will hv when we create it
                                so we know the permission (default) , we now need to knw the unmask value

Full Permissions      0666   0777
default Permissions   0600     ?            0777-0066 = 0711
                      ----   ----
 umask                0066   0066
                      ----   ----  

0 6 0 0 = rw-- --- --- 
next we set the unmask value to 0066


what is umask value?? umask is use to determine/set
the Permissions that files and directories will inherit at creation. 
It is Good for file security. 
umask value set the Default files permissions for users.

9 out of 10 situations we will not be using unmask 
9/10  = chmod 
1/10  = umask  

chmod  = change the permissions for individual files and directories  
chmod 600 fileName    
chown   = use change file ownership  
chgroup = use change file group ownership   
=======
        owner   group  other
d rwx--x--x. 2 ec2-user ec2-user    billions

- rw-------. 1 ec2-user ec2-user    blessed.me

                  billions    blessed.me
owner   ec2-user   7            6
group   ec2-user   1            0
others  anyone     1            0

3)Assign permission for dominion user (ie other) to read the blessed.me file  
     *********** here, we want to make the permission, the question gave us the umask value (read=4) and then its requesting for permission so the user can read


                      files   files
Full Permissions      0666    0666
default Permissions     ?  =    ?   = 0062
                      ----    ----
 umask                0600    0604
                      ----    ----  

default permission  = 0666 - 0604 = 0062

##################
while question is requesting for the unmask value for file that that will be created ,question3 is asking for the default persmission already gave us the unmask value (read)


Assignment:
Assign permission for the ec2-user group to modify the blessed.me file  
chmod +r fileName 
chmod 664 fileName  

                      file   file
Full Permissions      0666   0666
default Permissions   ?    =    ?            0666-0624 = 0042
                      ----   ----
 umask                0600   0624
                      ----   ----  


default permisssion=  0666 - 0624 = 0042


***************************************************************************************
Assignment: i  set myself
Assign permission for the ec2-user group to modify the billions file  
chmod +r fileName 
chmod 721 fileName  

                      file   file
Full Permissions      0666   0666
default Permissions   ?    =    ?            0666-0721= 0935  OR 0045
                      ----   ----
 umask                0711   0721
                      ----   ----  

default permisssion=  0666 - 0721 = 0935 ( subractracted mathematcally by borrowing )lol

*************************************************************************************************************


                                                 FILE MGT COMMANDS
WE can use the chmod command to assign /chnage permission to specify files for all the files created to have/ inherit a particular specify permission

read=4 
write=2
execute=1   

ec2-user  landmark  obi 

[ec2-user@demo ~]$ ll blessed.me
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 0 May  5 00:02 blessed.me


   ***************** 

Assignment:
Assign permission for the dominon user to read the blessed.me file

chmod 600 filename
chown = use to change file ownership
chgroup = use to change file group ownership


chmod +r fileName :  gives evryone permission to read
the correct code = chmod 604 fileName  


********************
obi will be working on the blessed.me for this sprint, 
please grant ownership of the file to obi  
This practice is good for automation and easy deployment
of tasks/workloads. 

ANS:
chown newOwner fileName   
chown obi blessed.me    
[ec2-user@demo ~]$ chown obi blessed.me
chown: changing ownership of 'blessed.me': 
  Operation not permitted
This is because:
chown and chgroup commands can ONLY be run by the rootUser
sudo is a command used to run commands as another user  

**************  therfore the correct command : 
sudo -u root chown obi blessed.me 
    sudo chown obi blessed.me  
sudo -u obi  chown obi blessed.me      

before you run the command mk sure the owner is running the command  ( i bliv chown without sudo , u hv to be rootuser)
[ec2-user@demo ~]$ sudo - u root chown obi blessed.me   OR  sudo chown obi blessed.me



***********     TO change group ownership

[ec2-user@demo ~]$ sudo -u obi  chgrp obi blessed.me
chgrp: cannot access 'blessed.me': Permission denied

sudo chgrp obi blessed.me

QUESTION:
   ****************    obi will be working on the billions directory for this sprint, 
please grant ownership and group ownership of the dir to obi  

sudo chown obi billions  
sudo chgrp obi billions  

sudo chown obi:obi billions   ...... the best



                                   GREP COMMAND


grep command = extract patterns from files  
grep simon list     
grep -i simon list
 where -i =  ignores case sensitivity   

simon 

 [ec2-user@demo ~]$ grep obi  /etc/passwd
obi:x:1001:1001::/home/obi:/bin/bash

pipe command = |  
   Enable the output of a command to be
   the input of another/next command 

cat list | grep -i legah   

IQ: explain the grep and the pipe commands ?
