LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD


TYPES OF TESTING, CODE QUALITY TOOLS, CODE QUALITY BENCHMARK, COMPARING ACTUAL RESULT AGAINST BENCHMARK, CODE QUALITY, SONARQUBE COMPRISES OF COMPUTE ENGINE, SEARCH ENGINE, DATABASES, WWEBSERVER, WHERE IS THE SONARQUBE HOME DIR
 VERSIONS OF SONARQUBE WE CAN INSTALL IN OUR ENVIRONMENT, 

code quality with sonarqube & sonar cloud etc
 in our env we use Sonarqube, sonarqube has to do with software quality 
we develop the application, we build the appl and it is deployed to the applictaion servers but before the app is deployed we have to perform software testing
so we use sonarqube for code quality analysis
 there is a quality gate in maven 
however, it runs unit testing on the number of testcase developers have written but most of the time developers will not write the code as desired thats why we need code quality tool to check, 
also for the software testin, maven doesnt check if developers have written the desired number of testcases and tahst why sonarqube is important as well


Types of testing that can be performed 
1)unit testing  [Junit )  : this is done to test individual components, units or lines of a code
2)functional testing: we test how the code is functioning, how the application is working
