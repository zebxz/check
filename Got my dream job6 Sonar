LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD


TYPES OF TESTING, CODE QUALITY TOOLS, CODE QUALITY BENCHMARK, COMPARING ACTUAL RESULT AGAINST BENCHMARK, CODE QUALITY, SONARQUBE COMPRISES OF COMPUTE ENGINE, SEARCH ENGINE, DATABASES, WWEBSERVER, WHERE IS THE SONARQUBE HOME DIR
 VERSIONS OF SONARQUBE WE CAN INSTALL IN OUR ENVIRONMENT, 

code quality with sonarqube & sonar cloud etc
 in our env we use Sonarqube, sonarqube has to do with software quality 
we develop the application, we build the appl and it is deployed to the applictaion servers but before the app is deployed we have to perform software testing
so we use sonarqube for code quality analysis
 1) validate    2) compiles   [app.java >>> app.class]     3) testing (run unit testing) pass    4) pacakges will be created
therefore; there is a quality gate in maven 
however, it runs unit testing on the number of testcase developers have written but most of the time developers will not write the code as desired thats why we need code quality tool to check, 
also for the software testin, maven doesnt check if developers have written the desired number of testcases and tahst why sonarqube is important as well


Types of testing that can be performed 
1)unit testing  [Junit )  : this is done to test individual components, units or lines of a code
2)functional testing: we test how the code is functioning, how the application is working
performance testing   is it performing as desire 
5)penertration To test if anyone can break into the system  using any username & password
   44.22  *** these are some of the categories that sonarqube is checking for.

with sonarqube we can run some analysis ie comparing actual results against the benchmark/standards is analysis:
1. How many unit test cases were run?
   How many test cases should have been run? 
 COMPARING ACTUAL RESULT AGAINST BENCHMARK

comparing actual results against the benchmark/standards is analysis:
1. How many unit test cases were run?
   How many test cases should have been run? 

2. Is our code readable with ease?   ........ AVoid complex code
    ----> code smells 

3. Is our code portable [ environment independent ]?
portable code means the code is not environment indenpendent 
we can run the code in diff environment like diff environment , port environment & test environment
    -- if not code smells / hard coding 

4. Are there vulnerabilities in the code ?
    ---> if they are then --- 
     eg  password is only 4 characters can result in security breach

Therfore we can set our standard/expectation for our code

Benchmark/standards for a quality Software/application:
1. Code coverage should be greater than 85%  
2. Dublicate lines should be less than 5% 
3. There should be no vulnerabilities in the code [pw=1234] 
4. Code smells should be less than 5  


example of code smell, writing codes without following certain standards could result to code smell
also hardcoding: ie writing scripts that are not dynamic
 code smell is not following the right syntax , writing bad codes with poor syntax, writing codes that are not dynamic , duplicate code or bad code, 
duplication can be avoided by using function

      
CODE QUALITY

Code Quality expectations:
• Duplicated code  ---  avoided using Functions, • Coding standards, • Unit tests, • Complex code, • Comments, • Potential Bugs, • Architecture & Design



                  SONARQUBE COMPRISES OF /this is the architect of sonarqube

SonarQube comprises of:
  1. sonarqube Scanner: from sonaqube scanner, the codes are sent to the sonarqube server, the server has 4 component
  2. sonarqube server :   This comprises of 
       Compute engine : that calculates and gives us values
       search engine - which is elasticsearch
       web-server : means we can access sonarqube information on the browser
     database - h2 database
 we have relational and non-relational databases
1. mySQL = RDS   = Relational databases
  generally data is structured and stored in tables[rows and columns] format         ******* it uses rows and column
 ie to say we have mySQL = RDS
mySQL is a langague used to qwery  RDS.   :
  SQL = structured qwery langaguage  
 
eg of structured databases
    oracle, mySQL  - OS, PostgreSql  - OS, MSSQL (MicrosoftSQL), DB2, Sybase
    MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL 

 data is stored ***** using rows and column
This type of structured is used to prepare report if we are collecting structured data from end users

2. noSQL = noRDS = non Relational databases, unstructured data and stopped in JSON format
Using json format we can get the information like this:
USING Json format to store the users information/data
  user1 = name/tel/address  
  user2 = name/ssn/date of birth  
  user3 = place of birth / profession / tel
   generally data is unstructured and stored in JSON format  

1:12:20  Examples of databases (which we will be seeing later in the course) that are used to manage non Relational database:
    MongoDB --, Cassandra, CouchDB, CouchBase, HBase, Redis, Riak, 
Neo4J are the popular NoSQL databases.
