when u login to AWS u choose the AMI (LINUS, macoS , ubuntu, windows, redhat etc) 
my Ami is like my operatin sys u wnt the ec2 instance to be based on 
then instance type e.g t2 micro, it specifies what your memory is and what your cpu is
then the key pair n that is if you hv the intention to log into the instance bc you can lauch an instance without a key pair ********************************
forb the netwrk, u can select the ntwrk the ec2 instance will be e.g the subnet , security grp , all these re optional
u hv the option to configure the storage , vol, hw much ebs vol the instance wil hv when its launched
all these are optional, 
but we saw that one of the requirments when creating an instance is to select the AMI and also the instance type which mounts or maps hw many vpc or memory u wil hv on ur instance 
once these 2 hv been selected you can then launch your instance.


bt if i ask u in 2wks to create the same instance nxrt week , chnaces are you may nt remember the exact securty grp , or key that u used b4 
so dis prosces of creatin a resource on the console is nr repeatalbe, thats why in the industry they want a sys that is repeatable, they wnt u to create infrsature that is always 
consistent, an infrastrue that u can crate d same tin over n over again, cos if i hv a sysytem that is repeatble then its easy to manage.

THIS BRINGS US TO THE PROCESS CALLED INFRASTURE AS A CODE  6:17
we ar nt craetying infrasture on the console but instead we ar creating infrasture as a code 
when ever u hv anytin written in code format that process is repeatabe bc the code will reamain the same n evrytime u execute the code u get the same result e.g u hv a script to
instal a jenkins server that script is repeatable bc as long as u run the script evrytime, it wil always provision the same thing evrytime,  that
process is what is called infrasture as a code. 

SO  as we start off this series of terraform going tru infastructure as a code some of the thins we ar going to be looking at as we do tonight just abt our introduction 
wea re gouin to b focuing on a tool called terraform

INTRODUTION TO TERRAFORM  ... 7:50
Terraform is a tool that helps us build our infrasture in a code format so that we no ,longer nid to go on the console to provision our infrasture bnc we want 
process to be repeatbel. so that 2wks/onths  frm now i can run the sam ecod3e n when i do that i can always provison the same resources. 
so bc of that it enhnaces speed , enhances a process that is repaetalbe, over and over  n u get the same result just bc u ar using code.

we wil look at the key concepts 
definition, benefits, vendor, workflow, syntax  etc
b4 we use terrform, we hv to install it

********************************  READ UP THE POWER POINT SCRIPT******************************* 11: 30 
INFRASTRUCTURE AS A CODE: MEANING   
1)managing and provisoning of infrsatruture tru code instaed of manually.
so instaed of u going to the console to manage or provison infrasture , u can write a code n use the particulr coseb to craeet infrasture
so intaed of creatuing ec2 instance in aws , we are able to wirte it  i bliv (ec2 instance ) n v terraform go to aws and create the same ec2 instance for us.
this process is repeatable bc i can create 20 of the same ec2 instance and all of them wil be exactly the same bc they ar using the same code
and that swhat infrasture as a code is 
2)files that contain configurations are created n makes it easy to edit and contribute
so we are goin to create this terraform files n bc we v created these files,its easy to distribute bc we can push theSE files in our SCM 

****** helps avoid undocumented, ad-hoc  configuration changes 
this means that if i hv an ec2 instance, i can easily go on the console n add a tag on the console, when i do dis its is called ad-hoc configuration changes,
theses are changes that am editing manually but they are undocument bc no one knws who changed the code , no one knws who added the tag ,so that is undocumented ad-hoc 
configuration 
but if am doing it tru code format then i can add the tag to my code n so its documented tht its me who made the changes bt also the chnages has be captured in code format 
n so the process is documnet n visible to everyone to see.

3)easy to version control
4)you can create infrastruture in modualar components , u are able to vv the codes in modules
e.g i can v a vpc as a module, an ec2 instance as a moudle , s3 as a module sn be able to createa all dis infrastruture as a module 
5)gives you a template to follow for provisioning
e.g ur boss ask u to create a vpc in north virginia,, may ders a vpc in california that was created u are able to look at the code , the requimrnet, how thay provision the
vpc in carlifornia, so that gives u a template, u are able to copy that code or use it for a denmo, as an example of whjat u are creating , so that becomes a template
thats the baeuty of writing code OR  creating infrasture IN code FormaT, IT GIVES U A TEMPLAte

benefits 
1cost reduction
u create it once 
ie it reduces the time used to do the actual work
2reduc error
b4 u depoy , u look n test the code 
3) improve infrstrure consistency
even if u create 5vpcs , the parameter remains the same 
4) eliminates configuratin drift
if i v created an ec2instance based on some parameters i v passed in my code, those are the only attributes that wil be captured on my instance, i will n t hv anytin more
than what is in the code, so i wont hv a lot of changes in my configurayion,  so i wnt v a drift in the configuration bc evryb i anticipatecd that my instance nids to hv 
is been captured in the code.

interview quetsions
what is IAC
waht are the benefits of iac
hv u evr implamemterd IAC in ur environment.


19:38   .......................... READUP SCRIPT
Now we are being introduced to a tool called terraform : MEANING
Iaac tool from Hashicorp
its uses HCL- hashicorp configuration language- human readable
HASHICORP is the vendor
hashicorp has other several products, once is called packer, it can automatically create AMIs , u can customize ur AMI
for security:1) vault, 2) boundary
vault , it can give us dynamic credentials , it can go to AWS, get credentials for us and inject it into our pipeline.
...
terraform is platform agnostic: meaning, u can use it on linux , on windows, mac ox, its also cloud agnostic , meaning: u can run it on multiple cloud
tereraform can create resource on multiple cloud,e.g aws , azure, alibaba, gcp, k8, helm
state mgt: terraform manages a state file, it creares a stae file , is shows exactly what terraform is doing, so when it creates a resource, it creates a file that captures evrytin
that it has done,it shows u the state of ur infrastructure so u can look at that file n knw hw many resouces u hv 
 u can look at the file n knw the sate of ur infrasture
it creates opeartor confidence bc  when u using terraform as an operator it gives u confidence,  once u hv all ur configuration file , terraform wil give u a plan 
n as u cretae resources , terraform manges them for you, so it gives u confidence bc it shows u exactly what u have.

25:32
TERRADORM Configuration files
terra uses declarative syntax to describe ur infrastructure (iac0 n thne perists it in configuration files that can be shared, reviewed, edited, versoned, preservedn reused
**************this means that we create a file thats ritten in HSC language, the file describes the infrasture, so u v a configration file that terraform wil use, it can 
be in 2 foremt either : HCL langusge or JSON format which is machine readable.
config files that use the HCL format must end wit . tf file extension for terrafrom to be able to read it , it nt terraform wont read it.
while JSON File format must end with .tf.json file extenson.
these aare the basic inf u nid regarding terraform .

TERRAFORM INSTALLATON 29:40
its very easy to install.
1) you can down load the binary
2) you can use a package manager, which is the easiest way to do it
choco or choco install terraform -y

TO know if terrafrom has been installed in ur env, if u just type Terraform, it wil give u an output, listing many terraorm commands
we can install terraform in our local env,  ie (mobaxterm)
we can also install terraform on an ec2 instance,, ie create an inatsnce using file to install terraform ....... 31:20
either way once u type terfaorm in ur local env it shud give u the same output showing the list of commands

NEXT:
bc we will be writing codes, u need a code editor
e.g vs code editor..... visual studio code


34:50
ONCE TERRAFROM HAS BEEN INSTALLED, HOW DO U USE TERRAFORM
TERRaform is a third party application that is hosted/managed by hashicorp

when u wnat to use terraform in ur env (wher wver ur env is)
so u hv ur aws account, u nid terraform to create a resource for u in ur account
so 1) u  will nid to hv terraform binary , which is why we are downloading it, bt as we v it, we nid to give it specifications
what do we wnt ot do in aws, gcp, azure, we are giing it specifications, wich is in the form of configuration files, we are writing files in our env using the terrafform
workflow, we run the terraform workflow
so b4 teraform interacts with aws it wil nid to be authenticated bc it is a 3rd party appl, for it to be auth , it wil rely on the inf that u as a user wil provide it with.

*************there are number of ways terraform allows u to pass credentials to it, credentials to interact with AWS
 FORMS OF CREDENTIALS U CAN GIVE TERRAFORM INORDER TO ACCESS UR AWS ACCOUNT
 for me to be able to do anytin in aws i need to v permission/to be authenticated , e.g i nid  access key n secret key thta auth  me to access the my secret n access key 
actually nid to v permission to actually create an ec2 instance
thats hw persmission works in aws
so the same tin applies to terraform, it will need credentila that wil enable it to go to AWS and create a resource based on the specification that you have given it
once its authenticated, it wil retrun for u a plan n say based on specification this is the paln , this is what we ar goin to do ,and once u apprv ethe plan , terraform wil
go ahead n create ur resource n once taht is done, it now has what is called a state file, and it wil keep a copy of ur file(state file) locally so that it wil show u 
exactly what resources u hv, that will be captured on this file which is called a state file

ALL THESE ARE INTERVIEW QUESTION
1)what is a state file
this is a file athat mahages the stae of ur infrasture, it give u a picture of ur infrasture, what is the actual state of ur infrasture, it is captured as a file
2)does terraform need credentioals to intercst with cloud provider like an API, like aws
yes terrarfeom needs credentilas 
3)how do we pass credentials to terraform ??.....................44.30
credentials:
firts , if u are trying to create resources in aws, u must hv an aws account, the same applies to GCP , or azure

for AWS, we need to generate security credentials in the console
so to do that, we go to the IAM user n create seceurity credentials wher we create an access key    
  we can create n IAM user............................. 46:00
and add to admin grp
it has allow all actions on all resources
