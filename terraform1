when u login to AWS u choose the AMI (LINUS, macoS , ubuntu, windows, redhat etc) 
my Ami is like my operatin sys u wnt the ec2 instance to be based on 
then instance type e.g t2 micro, it specifies what your memory is and what your cpu is
then the key pair n that is if you hv the intention to log into the instance bc you can lauch an instance without a key pair ********************************
forb the netwrk, u can select the ntwrk the ec2 instance will be e.g the subnet , security grp , all these re optional
u hv the option to configure the storage , vol, hw much ebs vol the instance wil hv when its launched
all these are optional, 
but we saw that one of the requirments when creating an instance is to select the AMI and also the instance type which mounts or maps hw many vpc or memory u wil hv on ur instance 
once these 2 hv been selected you can then launch your instance.


bt if i ask u in 2wks to create the same instance nxrt week , chnaces are you may nt remember the exact securty grp , or key that u used b4 
so dis prosces of creatin a resource on the console is nr repeatalbe, thats why in the industry they want a sys that is repeatable, they wnt u to create infrsature that is always 
consistent, an infrastrue that u can crate d same tin over n over again, cos if i hv a sysytem that is repeatble then its easy to manage.

THIS BRINGS US TO THE PROCESS CALLED INFRASTURE AS A CODE  6:17
we ar nt craetying infrasture on the console but instead we ar creating infrasture as a code 
when ever u hv anytin written in code format that process is repeatabe bc the code will reamain the same n evrytime u execute the code u get the same result e.g u hv a script to
instal a jenkins server that script is repeatable bc as long as u run the script evrytime, it wil always provision the same thing evrytime,  that
process is what is called infrasture as a code. 

SO  as we start off this series of terraform going tru infastructure as a code some of the thins we ar going to be looking at as we do tonight just abt our introduction 
wea re gouin to b focuing on a tool called terraform

INTRODUTION TO TERRAFORM  ... 7:50
Terraform is a tool that helps us build our infrasture in a code format so that we no ,longer nid to go on the console to provision our infrasture bnc we want 
process to be repeatbel. so that 2wks/onths  frm now i can run the sam ecod3e n when i do that i can always provison the same resources. 
so bc of that it enhnaces speed , enhances a process that is repaetalbe, over and over  n u get the same result just bc u ar using code.

we wil look at the key concepts 
definition, benefits, vendor, workflow, syntax  etc
b4 we use terrform, we hv to install it

********************************  READ UP THE POWER POINT SCRIPT******************************* 11: 30 
INFRASTRUCTURE AS A CODE: MEANING   
1)managing and provisoning of infrsatruture tru code instaed of manually.
so instaed of u going to the console to manage or provison infrasture , u can write a code n use the particulr coseb to craeet infrasture
so intaed of creatuing ec2 instance in aws , we are able to wirte it  i bliv (ec2 instance ) n v terraform go to aws and create the same ec2 instance for us.
this process is repeatable bc i can create 20 of the same ec2 instance and all of them wil be exactly the same bc they ar using the same code
and that swhat infrasture as a code is 
2)files that contain configurations are created n makes it easy to edit and contribute
so we are goin to create this terraform files n bc we v created these files,its easy to distribute bc we can push theSE files in our SCM 

****** helps avoid undocumented, ad-hoc  configuration changes 
this means that if i hv an ec2 instance, i can easily go on the console n add a tag on the console, when i do dis its is called ad-hoc configuration changes,
theses are changes that am editing manually but they are undocument bc no one knws who changed the code , no one knws who added the tag ,so that is undocumented ad-hoc 
configuration 
but if am doing it tru code format then i can add the tag to my code n so its documented tht its me who made the changes bt also the chnages has be captured in code format 
n so the process is documnet n visible to everyone to see.

3)easy to version control
4)you can create infrastruture in modualar components , u are able to vv the codes in modules
e.g i can v a vpc as a module, an ec2 instance as a moudle , s3 as a module sn be able to createa all dis infrastruture as a module 
5)gives you a template to follow for provisioning
e.g ur boss ask u to create a vpc in north virginia,, may ders a vpc in california that was created u are able to look at the code , the requimrnet, how thay provision the
vpc in carlifornia, so that gives u a template, u are able to copy that code or use it for a denmo, as an example of whjat u are creating , so that becomes a template
thats the baeuty of writing code OR  creating infrasture IN code FormaT, IT GIVES U A TEMPLAte

benefits 
1cost reduction
u create it once 
ie it reduces the time used to do the actual work
2reduc error
b4 u depoy , u look n test the code 
3) improve infrstrure consistency
even if u create 5vpcs , the parameter remains the same 
4) eliminates configuratin drift
if i v created an ec2instance based on some parameters i v passed in my code, those are the only attributes that wil be captured on my instance, i will n t hv anytin more
than what is in the code, so i wont hv a lot of changes in my configurayion,  so i wnt v a drift in the configuration bc evryb i anticipatecd that my instance nids to hv 
is been captured in the code.

interview quetsions
what is IAC
waht are the benefits of iac
hv u evr implamemterd IAC in ur environment.


19:38   .......................... READUP SCRIPT
Now we are being introduced to a tool called terraform : MEANING
Iaac tool from Hashicorp
its uses HCL- hashicorp configuration language- human readable
HASHICORP is the vendor
hashicorp has other several products, once is called packer, it can automatically create AMIs , u can customize ur AMI
for security:1) vault, 2) boundary
vault , it can give us dynamic credentials , it can go to AWS, get credentials for us and inject it into our pipeline.
...
terraform is platform agnostic: meaning, u can use it on linux , on windows, mac ox, its also cloud agnostic , meaning: u can run it on multiple cloud
tereraform can create resource on multiple cloud,e.g aws , azure, alibaba, gcp, k8, helm
state mgt: terraform manages a state file, it creares a stae file , is shows exactly what terraform is doing, so when it creates a resource, it creates a file that captures
evrytin that it has done,it shows u the state of ur infrastructure so u can look at that file n knw hw many resouces u hv 
 u can look at the file n knw the sate of ur infrasture
it creates opeartor confidence bc  when u using terraform as an operator it gives u confidence,  once u hv all ur configuration file , terraform wil give u a plan 
n as u cretae resources , terraform manges them for you, so it gives u confidence bc it shows u exactly what u have.

25:32
TERRADORM Configuration files
terra uses declarative syntax to describe ur infrastructure (iac0 n thne perists it in configuration files that can be shared, reviewed, edited, versoned, preservedn reused
**************this means that we create a file thats ritten in HSC language, the file describes the infrasture, so u v a configration file that terraform wil use, it can 
be in 2 foremt either : HCL langusge or JSON format which is machine readable.
config files that use the HCL format must end wit . tf file extension for terrafrom to be able to read it , it nt terraform wont read it.
while JSON File format must end with .tf.json file extenson.
these aare the basic inf u nid regarding terraform .

TERRAFORM INSTALLATON 29:40
its very easy to install.
1) you can down load the binary
2) you can use a package manager, which is the easiest way to do it
choco or choco install terraform -y

TO know if terrafrom has been installed in ur env, if u just type Terraform, it wil give u an output, listing many terraorm commands
we can install terraform in our local env,  ie (mobaxterm)
we can also install terraform on an ec2 instance,, ie create an inatsnce using file to install terraform ....... 31:20
either way once u type terfaorm in ur local env it shud give u the same output showing the list of commands

NEXT:
bc we will be writing codes, u need a code editor
e.g vs code editor..... visual studio code


34:50
ONCE TERRAFROM HAS BEEN INSTALLED, HOW DO U USE TERRAFORM
TERRaform is a third party application that is hosted/managed by hashicorp

when u wnat to use terraform in ur env (wher wver ur env is)
so u hv ur aws account, u nid terraform to create a resource for u in ur account
so 1) u  will nid to hv terraform binary , which is why we are downloading it, bt as we v it, we nid to give it specifications
what do we wnt ot do in aws, gcp, azure, we are giing it specifications, wich is in the form of configuration files, we are writing files in our env using the terrafform
workflow, we run the terraform workflow
so b4 teraform interacts with aws it wil nid to be authenticated bc it is a 3rd party appl, for it to be auth , it wil rely on the inf that u as a user wil provide it with.

*************there are number of ways terraform allows u to pass credentials to it, credentials to interact with AWS

FORMS OF CREDENTIALS U CAN GIVE TERRAFORM INORDER TO ACCESS UR AWS ACCOUNT
 for me to be able to do anytin in aws i need to v permission/to be authenticated , e.g i nid  access key n secret key thta auth  me to access the my secret n access key 
actually nid to v permission to actually create an ec2 instance
thats hw persmission works in aws
so the same tin applies to terraform, it will need credentila that wil enable it to go to AWS and create a resource based on the specification that you have given it
once its authenticated, it wil retrun for u a plan n say based on specification this is the paln , this is what we ar goin to do ,and once u apprv ethe plan , terraform wil
go ahead n create ur resource n once taht is done, it now has what is called a state file, and it wil keep a copy of ur file(state file) locally so that it wil show u 
exactly what resources u hv, that will be captured on this file which is called a state file

ALL THESE ARE INTERVIEW QUESTION
1)what is a state file
this is a file athat mahages the stae of ur infrasture, it give u a picture of ur infrasture, what is the actual state of ur infrasture, it is captured as a file
2)does terraform need credentioals to intercst with cloud provider like an API, like aws
yes terrarfeom needs credentilas 
3)how do we pass credentials to terraform ??.....................44.30
credentials:
firts , if u are trying to create resources in aws, u must hv an aws account, the same applies to GCP , or azure

for AWS, we need to generate security credentials in the console
so to do that, we go to the IAM user n create seceurity credentials wher we create an access key    
  we can create n IAM user............................. 46:00
(and add to admin grp ,when i click on Administrator access , - JSON  , ..... it has allow all actions on all resources)
next
to generate security credentials  for this user, click seceurity credentials 
now  need  create access key (when creating, tick AWS cli , cos i wnt to use the credentials for my cli) n secret key
now we v the acess key, copy it 
this user has adminstrative access/credential
once u hv ur credentials    ><>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>........(COMMAND to configure AWS is in the landmark terraform installation script)
nxt we set the credentials n this is why we needed to hv AWS cli for most of bc we v been workin in aws,launching instances, loging into AWS, we hv our AWS cli setup  bt
once u hv ur AWS cli, u wil need to configure,  run aws configure so that u set ur crednetial
if u run jst the aws configure, it will set default credentials
now i go to my aws cLI (mobaxterm) run aws configure ............51:00 
it asks for the ke id n access key we copied , i paste it 
ask for region, i leave it as default region
now hv set my credentials
                           i bliv he meant the sys already created .aws dir
now when i cd into home cd ~/ .aws, it creates what is called a .aws dir in the home of the user
thats why am using ~ , its the home , ders a dir called .aws
now am in tthe config credentials
so when i run aws config , i am setting credentials and in the credentials i hv set a default profile

cat credentials , and i can see the default profile n i v an access key whic i jst set n i hv a secet key which i jsudt set  ,noow
this becomes my default profile  .......... 53:33
we can seee there are multiple profile here , ken profile, manager, mark
but when i run aws configure, just this command i am setting a default profile, 
default means if nothing else is passed, if nothing else is availablethen terafrm wil alkwys fall bk on whwat has been set as the default.
*****************************so once we v set our credebtials , how can we then pass this credentials???............ 54.54
we can use teraform especially when we look at credentials, we can pass those credentails a sa profile

HOW MANY WAYS THOS ETERRA FORM ALLOW US TO PASS THOSE CREDENTIALS????
for us to knw hw to use thsoe credn , we nid to knw the command basis n nid to knw hw to write a teraform configuration so we knw  wher we can pass our credentials

SOMEBODY QUESTION: 1)
show us how to setup the CLI abi how to run aws configure, saw u are running directly frm ur macbk bt all along we hv been seting up the servers in aWS
prof said if u hv gitash/mbaxtem/vs code installed in ur envr run aws configure bc we wnt to config ur credentials, u config ur credntials in ur local envrn for security 
reasson u, if ur using ec2 instances, u dnt configure static credentials in aws, if u are using ec2 instance, u create a role and attach to the instance bt ur nt using a
key in ur instance bc if u set a key that is static, anybody who has has ccess to ur instance that becomes a security issue
so using ec2 instance, we instaed create a role n give permission to the role, we always attach roles to resources. bt in ur local env u hv ur aws cli configure.
am showing that we can run terrform from our local env, we can write code in our local envn n mg8 resources in aws n 2mrw we ill see that we can instal teraform on an ec2
instance n create a role, give permission to the role n the ec2instance wil perform action in aws on ur behalf


QUESTION2
WE V INSTALL the aws cli n now can the aws provision resources in aws? ........... yes 
ok since t can do that n terafrom can also do that so whats the diff btw the 2
  .. ANS..
WE can use aws CLI to provision resources in AWS bt AWS CLI  is native to aws bc i cant use it to provisin resources in azure or gcp , thats bc a cli just for aws
the benefti that terrform brings is that its cloud agnostic , i can use terraform in aws, gcp, azure, k8 ... etc
thats why companies are adopting teraform as an iaac

QUESTION3
why do we v the multiple profiles?/
when u run just aws configure you configure a defualt profile n each time u set a new default profile, it overrides the previous default profile
but when u run aws configure --profile amaka , this wil create a name profile called amaka , bc you pass an option, we can also vi into the credentials file n add d secret, 
acess keys n create a square bracket n put the nmae of the profile ......... 1:08
so when am runing my teraform, if i dnt want it to use my default credentials , i can pass a profile
e.g i v a developer profile n it only has read ccessn and i wnt to tets my code wit jst read access, so yes i can v and mg8 multiple accounts, u can send me a secrte key 
frm ur account n i can create a profile here n anythin i do using ur profile, it wil be happening in ur account bc this credentials they also hv a mapping of the account
they v permissions of the prticular account that supply the credential. bt if i switch to my default, its hapening in my account, dats hw we use profiles n we wil see hw we 
can use diff profiles for our teraform runs.
on the console, we can only create access n secret keys, we cant create profile on the console. bt when we wnt to configure our CLI env then we can then configure a profile
like this to be able to call aws on our behalf. .............. 1:07
just mk sure u hv set ur credential b4 u are able to use terraform.

A)TERRAFORM COMMAND BASICS ............................................................ ..  ...............1:09:30
terraform configuration files, its declarative in nature , must  with .tf   

B)TERRAFORM WORKFLOW
includes a number of commands we run to inorder to create  a conf file
let say u v written ur configuration files , now u hv multiple conf files , the files are in the same dir , that dir is called ur terraform working dir

INTERVIEW QUESTION:
WHAT IS A TERRAFORM WORKING DIR 
this a dir wher u v terraform config files
THATS Wher terraform wil be reading the files n creating a plan ..................1:13

the first command to enable terraform read the files is:
1)terraform init
its used to initialize a working directory containing terraform config files.
this is the 1st command that shud be run after writing a nwe conf file.
it downloads providers n modules.  ........................................................1:15
what this means is that the when u go to ur terraform n look up registry , u see browse providers , browse module, policy librabries
providers are what provides the service , e.g we can see aws, alibaba, gcp, etc, all these are providers that i can use wit terraform.
providers are logical abstractions of an app stream API, they are responsible for understanding API interactions n exposing resources.
therfore if am using terform n inwant to create resources in aws, therfor i need an AWS provider, it acts as an API, its what stands in btw terrfrm n ur aws to be able to 
interprete what terrafr intens to do in aws
********************so once u run terrafrm init, the first init does is it downloads the resource that u want to use
if i wnt to create a resource in aws, i wil need tell terfrm thta my provider is aws but hw do i do that, ? it thefore means that i need a configuration file  .... 1:18 00
if u v ur vscode n uv instaled an extension , when u go to extension n serach harsicop/terraform , click the first one , this is an extension, once u v the extension, 
it wil help u wit writing ur code for auto completion bcx  it knows what u intend to do, n u wil see this symbol symbolizing harsicop, dat shows your ext hv been installed.
if i go bk to my files, if i create any file that ends wit .ttf , i wil see this symbol, menaing this is a terafrm config file, inside thwe file  once i type provider,
bc of the ext it wil auto complete it for me n i can pass my provider "aws"   ..... .......  1:20: 50 
proviser "aws" {} , this 2 calibres means its a map, i can map key value pairs, i can put key value pairs inside, this hw we write/defin e a map,,.
so inside of ur privder block, it is a map , i can map diff resources
now if i go to my terminal n ls , i see the file
now i can run terraforn init , inside it. ... n we see it initializing
so bc i indicated aws as my provider, once i did terfm init , terfrm goes to the terfrm registry n looks for the rprivder i v ststed , once it goes to tht PARTICULAR 
PROVIDER it download th epluggin n bc i didnt specufty the version, it wil allways download the lastest version of ur plugin frm harscop, n once it downloads ur
provider plugin , insiden  of this dir it wil create for u one file (terafrm lock.hcl) n one dir ( a.terfrm dir)


INTERVIEW QUESTION:
whta is the purpose of terraform init/ when do w run it?
it i sthe first command we run to intialize our working dir and also to download our provider pluggings n also our modules.

2)TERAFRM VALALIDATE    ...... 1:25
it wil validiate the config file in the respective dir to ensure they are syntically valid n  internally consistent
U run this after terfrm init  and u will get success config is valid but if i miss the closn }, it wil say "error" uncosed config block
so bc d syntax is nt correct, i canrdo anytin else until i correct it 
so terfrm validate ensures the syntax is corect

3) TERAFRM PLAN
creats an execution plan
the best cause of action to follow/apply
4) Terasfrm app : used to apply the changes to reach the esired state of the configuration
by default scans the curent dir for d config n applies d cahnges appriopriately.
the state file is created when apply is ran the first time


*************once we strt taliking abt the diff blocks u guys wil ubderstand what it imeans..................
resourcev"aws_ instance" "project2ec2" {
i want to create an ec2 instance , am creatin it by----- using what is called a"  resource" block ............................................. 1:28:50
 the type : this is a resource type  :"aws_ instance"  ......  am creating an aws ec2 instance , bc my provider is aws 
the name: this is the resource name , the  name that trfrm wil knw   .... : project2ec2" , the name that wil b captured in the state file, a name that is local to trfrm .. and 
this is the name aws knows :   .......... "aws_ instance , the resource type known to aws but 

 ************************WATCH THIS PART .****************************** 1:30:20
****************************   AS we were talking abt creating an instance in aws console, we needed an ami n an instance type 
    *****************
in
to illustrae an example,  he started to create an instance in aws n he copied the AMI ID and paste it in the terform file (it is the AMI ID of the instance type 
resourcev"aws_ instance" "project2ec2" {
ami =    ****************************
instanc etype: "t2.micro" 

tags = {
 Name = "firstEC2"

***************now in my provider i v only passed 'aws" , i hv nt pass any credential and so the provider is goin to use the default credential bc it has to talk to aws
also i hvnt pased any region here so its going to use my region that i set in aws when i did aws configurebt aws configure default region is US west2

WATCH IT **********so lets see whats goin to happen  ............****************1:32:50
1)Terafrm init  ................minitializing, .
bc it already downloaded the plugggings, it wont download it again
2)terfrm validate  .............. valid, our AMI n instance type is valid 
3)terafrm plan .... terfrm goes now to aws, using the credentials that are default bc i hvnt passed any credentials yet for my provider, it assumes i wnt to use d default 
credentials 
it goes to aws n now generates a plan 4 me  .......... saying terfrm wil perfrm the folowing action
the plus sign means they are the things that will be added
**so far the tins that aRE knw is our AMI, instance type.........evrytin else we do not knw, bt we wil knw them after d instance hv been created,
terfm wil tel u "known after apply"
this AMI belongs to US East1
4)terafrm apply
we dnt knw the state of our infarsture yet, we dnt hv a state file yet
once we run apply, we know we hv an an created n a staefile to represent that.
when u run app, it wil fast run th eplan again, it wil regenertae the plan again n ask u to confirm
  . yes ...... n it stars creating the instance
************** bt we got an error ...............  ***** reason ...........??
first we knw that AMI are region specific 
we got our AMI id frm US east1 N virginia  but our default value is US west2 , so its trying to provison our resorces in US west2 bc we hvnt passed any region
and thats why we get the error
although when it ran the plan it says it was ok, it can execute it but apply is finding an ivalid AMi ( its nt found) bc we ar in the wrong region

to correct the error we will pass our region in the providr
region="us-east-1"
the region we pass wil overide the default region bt we ar stil uising d default credential.
lets say we wnt to pass a profile (credential)  profile = "marie"   .... bc its the provider that nids to authenticate
bc we v pass a profile , terfrm wil wnt to use the credentials that are identified within the profile
the profile i pass overides the default profile.

*lets see hw terfrm wil handle that**************
terfrm init ,, u can run it as many time 
terfrm plan  ............... ERRER, profilr marie nt found.............. 
so we comment the profile "#"
terfrm plan .................. sucessful
terfrm apply ............ ERROR ... NO specified vpc, no default vpc for this user............................ 1:44:00 ......... WATCH
whwat happens is that terfrm wil create it in d default vpc bc in my code i didnt specify ehrr i wnt to creaqte it 
if i go to my vpc in us est1, Virginia, i v 4vpcs bt ders no default vpc, so bc der no default vpc i hv to specify whiv vpc i nid to create this
n to specify i look at the subnet n pick n public vpc n copy the id of of d particular subnet n coopy the id 
and in my code i pass the id , so v specified that i wnt the instance to b created in that subnet bt if i dnt pass it wil wnt to create it in a default vpc
subnetid:*****************************, i can pass it as a sring bc dats wher i wnat to create my resources
terfrm plan
now we can see the plan creating the instance 
now we hv the instance id  and if u go to aws we see the TAG " FIRSTEC2" , Jst as the tag we indidcated in the code .............1:49:00
*********bc i hv creadted this instancE using code, it means that i can do this 10times n i wil stil create the same instance 
after the instance ahs been cretae it wil create a terfrm .tf state.... thisn is the  statefile
when u open it u wil see it has captured for you the steps, evrytin abt the instance its captured for u


5) tefrm destroy to terminate the resource  if no longer needed
it will generate a plan
we can see the plus sign has changed frm + to - 
if i say yes,
we can see it shutting down the instance in aws
this is hw terfrm is able to mag8 ur resources.

QUESTION:
can we use the mobxterm we are used to ?  yes we will
u hv any terminal that u hv ur aws configured then u will be able to run terfrm
in ur terminal download terfrm
as long as u hv ur aws cli configured

DIFF BTW TRM PLAN n TERFRM apply
trfrm gives u a plan without actually executing it , ie it gives the option of accepting or changing or destroy the plan while
apply creates the resources

what cred does trfrm use if we dnt pass it
it uses the default crdentials

HOW DO U sSET DEFAULT CREDENTIALS
we use aws configure

MY QUESTION
if we dnt tell terfm the region we wnt it to provide our resources, it wil create it in the default region set when u run aws config
if u dnt specify d  vpc or the subnet, , bc terfrm wil assume u wnt to create it in the default vpc
so if u dnt hv a default vpc,  terfrm wil return an error , c it wil b looking for  adefault vpc to b able to create ur resource
so if u dnt v a default vpc terfrm wil fail
so some of the prerequisite: if u want to create a resource in a default vpc mk sure the region u ar creating ur resource has a default vpc
so how do you create a default vpc ????? ....... i knw 


I SEE THE SCRIPT HAS A COMMANDC THAT SAYS FORMAT 
ANS:
terfrm has a lot of commands , we wil seee hw we ll format our code
what we did was a very basic code , we didnt nid to format the code 
when we write more code we see hw wev  can use more commands bt the basic work flow, init, validate, plan, apply, destroy


2:04:00 TERRAFORM CONFIGURATION LANGUAGE SYNTAX
    LANGUAGE SYNTAX
how do we write trfrm conf file  .... ....... ?

 when we write trfrm cong file , trfrm has what is xcalled top level blocks
blocks ar jsy representation of codes ,  hw we write code
terfrm has 10 top levelin wich anytin u wnt to write or createv in trfrm wil fall under one of those blks
e.g 
 we hv a name : provider 
a certain label :aws 
a blk wil always be btw this 2{}  which are a map 
in the calibres {} is always a map ., this map are jst key bvalue pairs we ar pasing in der, 
this is called a resoure block bc the block starts with the word: resource  .. resourcev"aws_ instance" "project2ec2"
a resource blk wil v 2labels , 
1) h e resource type ( in aws we v dif resourcese.g vpc, inernt gatway,) bt all our resoure in aws wil start wit the keywrd aws_ bc its a
resource that is knw to aws , if i wnt t create a resource blk , d 1st tin is d resource type n once i v the ext installed ,i wil hv to 
populate so i can selet frm the list of resources
2) resource name  .... the name must be unique to terfrm bc its possibl ethat i can crate 2resource the same vpc bt the name has to be diff ......... 2:08:
so the name has to b unique to trfrm bc if the nmaes ar nt unique trf wil nt kn w hw to mg8
