when u login to AWS u choose the AMI (LINUS, macoS , ubuntu, windows, redhat etc) 
my Ami is like my operatin sys u wnt the ec2 instance to be based on 
then instance type e.g t2 micro, it specifies what your memory is and what your cpu is
then the key pair n that is if you hv the intention to log into the instance bc you can lauch an instance without a key pair ********************************
forb the netwrk, u can select the ntwrk the ec2 instance will be e.g the subnet , security grp , all these re optional
u hv the option to configure the storage , vol, hw much ebs vol the instance wil hv when its launched
all these are optional, 
but we saw that one of the requirments when creating an instance is to select the AMI and also the instance type which mounts or maps hw many vpc or memory u wil hv on ur instance 
once these 2 hv been selected you can then launch your instance.


bt if i ask u in 2wks to create the same instance nxrt week , chnaces are you may nt remember the exact securty grp , or key that u used b4 
so dis prosces of creatin a resource on the console is nr repeatalbe, thats why in the industry they want a sys that is repeatable, they wnt u to create infrsature that is always 
consistent, an infrastrue that u can crate d same tin over n over again, cos if i hv a sysytem that is repeatble then its easy to manage.

THIS BRINGS US TO THE PROCESS CALLED INFRASTURE AS A CODE  6:17
we ar nt craetying infrasture on the console but instead we ar creating infrasture as a code 
when ever u hv anytin written in code format that process is repeatabe bc the code will reamain the same n evrytime u execute the code u get the same result e.g u hv a script to
instal a jenkins server that script is repeatable bc as long as u run the script evrytime, it wil always provision the same thing evrytime,  that
process is what is called infrasture as a code. 

SO  as we start off this series going tru infrasture as a code 
INTRODUTION TO TERRAFORM
