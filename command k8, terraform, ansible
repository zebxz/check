  kubeadm --> We can setup multi node k8's cluster using kubeadm.  ... kubeasm is a sfware that is used to launch a k8, both d control plane n worker node
    kubespray --> We can setup multi node k8s cluster using kubespray , it uses ansible playbook
     (Ansible Playbooks Used internally by kubespray).
  
first instal container-d n its dependecies bc our runtime (to b able to start&runour conatiners) is nt docker bt it is container
-d, once it is installed, we will proceed to start container-d  afterwhcih we wil instal kublet, kubeabm and kubectl,, after that we wil start the kublet
service i will run this as a script and i nid to be root user

Initialize Kubernetes control plane by running the below commond as root user.
sudo kubeadm init

run the 3commands as stated in the success notification in my cli  (mkdir -p $HOME/.kube .......)
we can cat .kube/config  file, we can see its content n this is d file authenticating us to carry out tasks and d  user now is the admin , so he has admin
access in d  cluster

we run : kubectl get node  or kubectl get pod
it shows the master node is not ready
7) so to ensure its ready we v to deploy the ntwrk plugging
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.8.1/weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml
************now it has created certain components 
now if we execute kubectl get node .............. our master node is ready

lets check all the pods in the cluster ..... kubectl -A 


kubectl get namespace
  kubectl get ns 

 kubectl create namespace fintech --v=8      . V , MEANS   in verbose
 kubectl create namespace dev     
 kubectl delete namespace dev


How to deploy run/execute tasks/workloads in kubernetes??
   1. Imperative  approach 
        By using commands 

   2. Declarative approach
        By using files [manifests files]  

-# Create POD Using Command
kubectl run <podName> --image=<imageName> --port=<containerPort> -n <namespaceName>
kubectl run hello --image=mylandmarktech/hello --port=80 -n dev 


ubuntu@master:~$  kubectl get po    ...... ........ 
no resources found in default namespace 
ubuntu@master:~$ kubectl get po -n dev
no resources found in dev namespace 

ubuntu@master:~$ kubectl get svc -n dev      .... to check for services
no resources found in dev namespace
