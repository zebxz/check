developers write and comit codes to github, we will use jenkins for automation, with jenkins you are sure to automate these processes. once this is committed to github, a
new commit/version of the application for eg, jenkins will pull, so we are goin to configure an automation for between jenkins and github that automation can be configured
using pull SCM or github webhook.
once jnekins clone the version, it will communicate with another tool called maven and the use of maven is to create packages before the packages are deployed jenkins is 
comunicating with sonarqube/ sonarcloud for code quality to check if the software written by developers is good enough for deployment .
if code quality analysis results to a pass, it means the application can be deployed to an app server which can be running on tomcat or JBOSS ie our client environment.

56:30
************* before we deploy we make sure it is backedup in artifacts 


we need to create a backup for our artifacts so that if in the process of deploying tesla there happens to be a failure our backup system is called nexus or Jfrog and our 
artifacts will be bcakedup here, so we are going to have repositories and and inside the repo eg, we will have teslar.war
there should be a monitoring system to monitor our system. 
therfore, jenkins will connect with a notifier so we are configuring a notification called newRelic . if there is a problem an alert will be triggerred that will send out 
email notification so members of the team will be notified that something is going wrong 
jenins acts as a distributor.


  *********you are a build and release enggr if you are able to deploy to tomact 
if you are able to carry out the automation where everything is configured to be able to deploy to tomcat. not even to deploy to tomcat, if you are able to upload artifacts to 
nexus, you are a build and release engr or CI, continous integration which falls under build and release engr which means you are a build and release engr



LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat/ngnix tomcat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD, jenkins automates the end to end process, 



having done Jenkins:
  1. Build + Release Engineer  
  2. AWS cloud    = Cloud Engineer 
         
  3. Docker       = is all abt containrizing application
  4. Kubernetes   = Application Engineer  / kubernete Engineer 
  5. Ansible      = System Automation Engineer  bc u can configure system n do a lot of things
  6. Terraform    = Infrastructure Engineer [ IaC ] terraform is all about infrastructure as a code
  7. DevSecOps    = dev sec ops engrbc we are heavy on security
  8. SRE          = site reliablty engr bc u are able to monitor ur environment and take actions with relative ease
  9. Sr. DevOps Engineer = and all this means u are a senior devops engr bc most of our engrs are having the senior role 
  10. Platform Engineer - Linux  .. focusing on linux bc so far we hv based our analysis on linux

********************  INTERVIEW
***** from sonarqube2*********
developers write and comit codes to github, we will use jenkins for automation, with jenkins you are sure to automate these processes. 
Thefore, we  integrate jenkins with sonarqube for code quality analysis, with nexus for our artifact repository, with maven for build, tomcat for deployment & with git to clone our codes from SCM,
once code is committed to github, a new commit/version of the application for eg, jenkins will pull, bc we configured an automation between jenkins and github 
*****IGNORE **********that automation can be configured using pull SCM or github webhook.
**********ignore**********  we need Jenkins Git Integration  ie, installing git in jenkins , we need this integration to be able to clone/pull the code/application from SCM - Github
once jnekins clone the version, it will communicate with another tool called maven and the use of maven is to create packages before the packages are deployed jenkins is 
comunicating with sonarqube/ sonarcloud for code quality to check if the software written by developers is good enough for deployment .
if code quality analysis results to a pass, it means the application can be deployed to an app server which can be running on tomcat or JBOSS ie our client environment.

in our env,before we deploy we make sure it is backedup in artifacts 
we need to create a backup for our artifacts so that if in the process of deploying,In a situation where the MAVEN server goes down in the deployment, we just discontinue the process and pull from our artifactories 
and our backup system is called nexus or Jfrog and our artifacts will be bcakedup there, 
for our deployment;
we do not recommend to deploy to one appserver/tomcat bc if the app goes down it will be a problem, therefore in our deployment we use ansible or universal code UCD deploY, to deploy to multiple servers for high availability
for high availabilty we have multiple app servers eg app server 1, app server 2, app server3 with the help of another automation tool called ansible
ALso,there should be a monitoring system to monitor our system. 
therfore, jenkins will connect with a notifier so we are configuring a notification called newRelic . if there is a problem an alert will be triggerred that will send out 
email notification so members of the team will be notified that something is going wrong 
 this is the pipeline process, JENKINS is all about automation and jenkins can help to automates the end to end process 
 so for automation; we integrate Jenkins with: Git/Github ,maven, Sonarqube, nexus ,tomcat, nginx webserver, all of these ensures continous deployment.
 we automate using build triggers in jenkins, we can schedule/programe our jenkins job to do a build whenever developers commit a code/diff versions, developers nid git for versioning
we can shedule when deployment is taking place by using build triggers
using  IDEs = Integrated Development Environment simplifies the deployment process  and pluggins; which extends the functionality of jenkins, maven, etc.

START    **** (THis is a more summarized version of only jenkins 1/2 & 3)

DevOps/JENKINS is all about automation   
Jenkins portNumber: 8080  


 JENKINS IS An automation tool
its an open source continous integration (CI) Tool within in java


DEVOPS
  Its not (just) tools      eg maven is not equal to devops
 git is not equals to devops
 thefore, devops is the never ending process of continous improvement 
for eg it includes continous integration, continous development, continous testing, continous deployment and continous monitoring
thats what devops is all about 
one can ask why continous integration?
continous integration helps in the early detection of bugs, helps in determining code-break, enables continous deployment, enables automated testing, reduce risk of longer time consuming project, increases the quality of software via 
continous code quality 

  (we are able to automate the task OF our CI pipline
when developers comit their code thers a build, unit testing is done, integration testing is done  , once that is performed we can now deploy the appl into production, been continous deployment bc we automated the process.

 Ci pipeline

       CONTIONOUS DELIVERY
52:27 when ther is namual approval it falls under continous delivery

    CD = Continous Delivery

       code            build        staging          MANUAL
     gitgithub     >>>>  test  >>>>> QA/UAT   >>>>   APPROVAL   >>>>>> PRODUCTION


CONTIONUS DEPLOYMENT
 when it is automated

 CD = Continous Deployment

        code            build        staging          
     gitgithub     >>>>  test  >>>>> QA/UAT   >>>>   AUTO  >>>>>> PRODUCTION

***JEN6****   Continuous Development ---> 
when developers commit to the master branch.
   Jenkins triggers a continuous integration job :
   If the CI job succeeds Jenkins will trigger the continuous Delivery  JOB   

 

 CONTINOUS INTGRATION
the process of deploying this to the staging environment is continous integration

   Developers commit code using git& github once thers a commit we want to build, after build its testing then we deploy to a test environment, eithr to the staging env or 
QA or user acceptance testing from there we deploy to production bt before deployment we need to perform additional testing, the process of additional testing can be manual 
or automated, it its manual it could include integration testing and so on.
mauual testing implies thers a manual approval, maual gate somebpdy need to maullay approve and say the job done, its good, take it to the market and mauual approval is 
called continous delivery but when its automated its continous deployment and the process of deploying this to the staging environment is continous integration

AUTOMATING BUILD IN JENKINS 

we can Automate builds using build triggers.
if u are doing software builds where developers are creating new version of the application, they are changing stuff constantly, we can configure pull SCM 
and every minute will make a REq IN GITHUB  searching for new version to do a 
a build  ( its all about versiong) if theres no new version , it doesnt do a build .    **** scm changes ie changes in SCM
 also we can configure  GitHub-webhook :
   GitHub will notify Jenkins to trigger a build once there is a change in the scm [src]  

**** so in github, we will create a webhook, if thers any change inour application , software or code, github will notify jenkins so therfore no need for 
a timer 
if thers a new version of the applictaion , if developers commit new version 
we can also configure webhook for something else eg if we want to do code quality analysis with sonarcloud , we can configure github webhook so that if
developers commit new version of the applictaion, code quality analysis will be executed in sonarcloud and report will be created
we will know thers a new version bc of new commits or pushes, the webhook will be triggered

WHY CONTINOUS INTEGRATION
one can ask why continous integration?
continous integration helps in the early detection of bugs, helps in determining code-break, enables continous deployment, enables automated testing, reduce risk of longer time consuming project, increases the quality of software via 
continous code quality 

when developers comit their code thers a build, unit testing is done, integration testing is done and thats our CI piple , once that is performed, (2nd part) we can now deploy the appl into production, so this entire process if it is
automated the first part is the CI proces and the 2nd is the CD process.
  
 (we are able to automate the task)
continous integration ensures continous deployment such that wherever our CI job succeeds we are going to trigger what is called cd jobs, cd is all baout continous delivery/
deployment

       CONTIONOUS DELIVERY
52:27 when ther is namual approval it falls under continous delivery

CONTIONUS DEPLOYMENT
 when it is automated

   Developers commit code using git& github once thers a commit we want to build, after build its testing then we deploy to a test environment, eithr to the staging env or 
QA or user acceptance testing from there we deploy to production bt before deployment we need to perform additional testing, the process of additional testing can be manual 
or automated, it its manual it could include integration testing and so on.
mauual testing implies thers a manual approval, maual gate somebpdy need to maullay approve and say the job done, its good, take it to the market and mauual approval is 
called continous delivery but when its automated its continous deployment and the process of deploying this to the staging environment is continous integration

                WHAT IS JENKINS AUTOMATION
 JENKINS IS An automation tool
its an open source continous integration (CI) Tool within in java

 Saas ( software as a service) doesnt take much time like Iaas which requires server installation
 GITHUB is a SaaS tool ---  server Installation NOT required    
      - Nexus is an IaaS tool ---  server Installation required        
 github is a software as a service while Nexus is an infrastructure as a service, Nexus needs an infrastructure to install nexus software 


1;14:54   Jenkins can be installed in multiple platforms 
linux, windows, MacOs, Solaris

Jenkins, is an open source Continuous Integration (ci/cd)
tool written in Java. 
Jenkins can be installed in Multiple Platforms:  
  Linux /Windows /macOS /Solaris 


***** not all software can be installed on all platform eg Ansible 
ansible  can be installed in Linux Platforms ONLY  :

***DEPLOYING WEB APPLICATION from video2 contd,  AUTOMATING BUILD IN JENKINS, HOW T O CREATE WEBHOOK


                             
AUTOMATING BUILD IN JENKINS 

Build Now:  is a limited measure of automation  

Automate builds using build triggers.

1:35:35
if u are doing software builds where developers are creating new version of the application, they are changing stuff constantly, we can configure pull SCM 

use cases:
     Software builds 
     application build and Deployment
     Started by an SCM change
   

     Started by user: LandmarkTechnologies = BuildNow  
     Started by timer: build periodically 
     Changes in SCM  : pollSCM

when we configure pull SCM , a build will be triggered but this only happens if theres a new version of the application

******* so i have a job java base fintech project in jenkins and bc i hv configured pull SCM, every minute will make a REq IN GITHUB  searching for new version to do a 
a build  ( its all about versiong) if theres no new version , it doesnt do a build .    **** scm changes ie changes in SCM

1:45
3. GitHub-webhook :
   GitHub will notify Jenkins to trigger a build once there is a change in the scm [src]  

****** so in github, we will create a webhook, if thers any change inour application , software or code, github will notify jenkins so therfore no need for a
timer 
if thers a new version of the applictaion , if developers commit new version 
we can also configure webhook for something else eg if we want to do code quality analysis with sonarcloud , we can configure github webhook so that if
developers commit new version of the applictaion, code quality analysis will be executed in sonarcloud and report will be created

1:48:00
we will know thers a new version bc of new commits or pushes, the webhook will be triggered

FREE Style project            when u use maven to do a build under free style project, u take more time &nid to do a lot of configurations(we ar always clicking on configure
software builds            so instaed of using freestyle we can use maven projects. to ensure d time used to configure d project is kept to the barest minimum, we use maven project

******** we can also build using graddle

jenkins pipeline is just a file we want to create a file , everytin will run inside a node, jenkins server is a node

PIPELINE JENKINS PROJECTS:    (comit id helps identify the diff versions)

FREE-style
maven
we want to create a pipeline that can automate the test and build process  
pipeline:  
  Jenkins Pipeline scripts are generally written in groovy ,, what is a groovy language?
  Jenkins Pipelines scripts are called Jenkinsfile   **(we hv pipeline script that u can write, we also hv pipeline script from scm)


              JENKINS FILE
Jenkinsfile is a file generally written in the groovy language:
Jenkinsfile helps to better manage and automate jenkins jobs/tasks .Jenkinsfile introduces infrastructure as a code concept with all its benefits 

         TYPES OF JENKINS SCRIPT
  we have scripted and  declarative Pipeline scripts
scripted file starts with a node while declarative starts with pipeline
scripted file is restricted to a particular node e.g in pipeline we hv  "agent any


  Continuous Development ---> 
when developers commit to the master branch.
   Jenkins triggers a continuous integration job :
   If the CI job succeeds Jenkins will trigger the continuous Delivery  JOB   

**** BUILDING FROM PRIVATE REPO  wil be done 9 out of 10 in the coy



JEN7&8
MULTI-BRANCH PIPELINE JOB,  CREATE A MULTI-BRANCH PIPELINE JOB , JENKINS SECURITY (RBAC), JENKINS EITH LDAP AUTHENTICATION SERVER
By default for Jenkins to start port 8080 must not be in use  


multiBranch Pipeline job : we can build in multiple branches
=========================
Project private repo - https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/maven-web-app  
   we are expected to see line of development
               Git Branches - Are Lines of development 

 someone is aking we hv nt deployed to tomcat ,, we are going to be deploying containerized app, tomcat was an introduction
  1:12:18 all of these is nt happening in one agent , mvn package will tk place in maven build server, sonar,the code quality analysis will talk to a 3rd party server wich is sonarqube server

our jenkins is running in linux

=======================
SHARED LIBRARIES    .. we execute jenkins shared lib to ease hw we write n manage jenkins file, so if i hv 24 jenkins files to write that are performing similar task 
                           ill use shared lib to simplify my job

apps: tesla-be (backend, tesla-myapp,  tesla-fe (frontend, tesla-wepapp
branches: master, dev. testing, uat, pre-prod, prod  
no of jobs = 24 jobs requiring 24 Jenkinsfiles ..dis a problem, means we hv to be writing the same jenkins file that is doing similar task like test n build
we hv what is called common stages, since they are all java projects, we are going to do a stage to do mvn test,clean package, these are all unique stages e.g
stage1 will be for mvn tesst , stage2 .... etc , most of the stages are common so we can prepare a shared library, which will bring 2geda all the common stages such 
that we can jst refer to them e.g we can create a shared lib that wil hv in it a common script

i can call this file ..; common stages: common.groovy 
so hv created a shared lib called common.groovy ,,
  unittesting:
  stage('1RunUnitTests'){ 
    sh  "mvn test" }
  packaging:
  stage('2Build'){ 
    sh "mvn package" }
  codequality:
  stage('3CodeQuality'){ 
    sh "mvn sonar:sonar" }
  artifactUpload:
  stage('4Upload'){ 
    sh "mvn deploy" }
  stage('14'){}
so if am trying to create my pipeline for each of this jobs, my pipeline wil b very simple, si if i wnat to crete a jenkins file 
illl jst be referring to common. so in all my jenkins file am not repeating code, i hv a shared lib common. groovy wil search for unittesting
each file will hv their unique git url 
Jenkinsfile:
node{
    stage ('1clone'){
        git 'gitURL'
    }
    stage('unittesting'){  (i.e the stage here is refering to common.grovy and it want to search for unittesting,it wil be done with relative ease
        common{
            stage 'unittesting'
        } 
    }
   stage('2mavenBuid'){    (i.e the stage here is refering to common.grovy and it want to search for packaging,it wil be done with relative ease
     common{
        stage 'packaging'
     }
   } 
   stage('3CodeQuality'){
     common{
        stage 'codequality'
     }
   } 
   stage('4Upload'){} 

}
we are managing 4 applications for tesla
  tesla-myapp :  
    dev  
    testing  
    uat  
    pre-prod  
    Production  
  tesla-be   :  
    dev  
    testing  
    uat  
    pre-prod  
    Production  
  tesla-fe  : 
    dev  
    testing  
    uat  
    pre-prod  
    Production  
  tesla-wepapp :    
    dev  


    testing  
    uat  
    pre-prod  
    Production  


JENKINS SECURITY
Jenkins security: where we do the changes depends on where jenkins was installed 


JENKINS WITH LDAP AUTHENTICATION SERVER
we need users to access  Sonarqube, nexus, jenkins, github, kubernetes. it will be too much manual work to create these users in all the servers so we can integrate
jenkins with LDAP authentication server,, so we'll hv all the login credentials of users , username n passwd stored in the LDAP then connect LDAP to communicate withjenkins
and each of the servers.then all the users are able to access jenkins automatically its called a single signup, where the signup credentials is configured in the LDAP server,
once u connect to LDAP sucessfully, u can connect to any other resource in ur environment. this all securing our jenkins environment. 


the reason why devops engr are paid so much moni is bc they can write jenkins file and its dif frm writing codes by developers wich is very complex 
writing code is more complex
