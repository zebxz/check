#### 23:16 even after authenticating we couldnt push to a private repo bc he nids to upgrade his account,its a payment issue , so we used anoda public repo

host port changes but :container port doesnt

image contain software, os, appl code
DOCKER FILE
FROM python:3.7
WORKDIR /opt/app
COPY .  .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements-prod.txt
EXPOSE 5000

pwd gave us /home/ubuntu/pfa (we renamed the repository file we cloned to  pfa)
so thta means we ar in home/ubuntu/pfa
COPY . . means to copy every tin frm my pwd of my home server to the pwd of my image am creating
COPY . . is similar to mvn package wher d artifcars ar been created, bc this is a python application so when creatingb the image it runs this for us: 
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements-prod.txt
and when you run/create a container it starts the applica

==============
  Deploy a nodeJS web application using docker: 
    1. use/Create/modify the Dockerfile   
    2. Use the Dockerfile to build a docker image  
    3. Push the image to an image registry[dockerhub/ecr/nexus/JFrog]
    4. pull, inspect and scan the docker image
    5. deploy applications using the image  
GithubRepo    =  https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/nodejs-application
dockerhubRepo =  mylandmarktech/nodejs-fe-app
                 docker push mylandmarktech/nodejs-fe-app:tagname

9:20 we v  a github and dockerhub repo for this project ?? does it mean we can use any of the repo ?????? 

we wnt to containerize the appli, n with the help of the docker file we ar able to 

clone the github repo , its a private repo n we cloned successfully
ls
cd nodejs-application/
ls , n we can see d docker file
cat docke file
docker ps , to check for containers 
i wn to build a node image
docker build -t nodeapp:1 .   , to build a docker image ........   ( nodeapp:1  ,ie   version 1)

docker tag nodeapp:1 mylandmarktech/nodejs-fe-app:33    ,,, tagging successful
docker push nodeapp:1 mylandmarktech/nodejs-fe-app:33
error pushing so we authenticate
docker login -u mylandmarktech
#### 23:16 even after authentiacting we couldnt push to the private repo bc he nids to upgrade his account,its a subscription issue , so we used anoda public repo
so we created tag for our image for a diff public repo in github
docker tag nodeapp:1 mylandmarktech/nodejs-app:2, to mk it distributable
docker push nodeapp:1 mylandmarktech/nodejs-app:2    ... image name: push nodeapp:1    ,, container name and tag: nodejs-app:2
#### we deleted all d images
so this:nodeapp:1 is no longer in our local servrer bt we hv shared it in our register when we created the tag above bt we didnt push it

## 24:18 in the ticket above we v a keyword EXPOSE 9981 , its our container port  for port forwarding, so to deploy the application:
 
docker run --name nodeapp -d -p 7777:9981 nodeapp:1
bt this : nodeapp:1 is nolonger in our local servrer bt we v shared it in our register when we created d tag above bt we didnt push it, so we dnt v nodeapp:1 anywhere


docker ps -q to list containers id
to stop the containers:   docker stop container ids
to remove stopped container : docker rm container ids

docker run --name nodeapp -d -p 7777:9981 nodeapp:1
###### bt this : nodeapp:1 is nolonger in our local servrer bt we hv shared it in our register when we created the tag above bt we didnt push it
so we v to use the image that is found in my registry the version2
docker run --name nodeapp -d -p 7777:9981 nodeapp:2  ,, i dnt hv hv nodeapp:2 in my local server bt i have it in my registry, in my image remote registry
29:58 so when i execute docker run,this will pull/use the image to create n start the container

36:24 ## 24:18 in the ticket above we v a keyword EXPOSE 9981 , its our container port  for port forwarding,so frm my docker engine, its forwarding the port to this
container, the port is forwarded internally b172.170.2:9981

host port changes but port address :container port doesnt
###### TO KNW WHAT PORT NUMBER TO USE AS THE HOST PORT 
      
to check the ports in use, we can run netstat -tulpn , n i can see the all the ports in use
to install netstat : sudo apt install net-tools
A servers has 2^16=65536 ports/addresses [0,1,2,3...,65635]
    nodeapp   =  7777 ,, WE delete this container n 
    nodeapp2  =  7777   deployed this on 7077

    netstat -tulpn

to acccess the restful APIs,  we go to the application file in github , w can see a file called app.js
in it there are some restful APIs 
se are some get req ie when developers develop the appl, its developed such that users are able to access diff restful APIs, 


RestFulAPIs .. ........ 52.08 ... this ARE jst get inf wher u can get some json details, account login etc
 ===========
   app.get('/landmarktechnologies
   app.get("/html
   app.get("/jsonData
   httpGetRequests:
     3.22.217.29:7777/  ...  this is the rootpath 
     3.22.217.29:7777/landmarktechnologies
     3.22.217.29:7777/html   
     3.22.217.29:7777/jsonData

   httpPostRequests:..  also http post req bc u can edith info 
      https://boa.com/edit 
        delete account details  
        modify details 
         password= 
#####so developers ar developing the appl such that u can perform diff tasks, so dey create some restful APIs

Bank of America  : ....these ar all inf for users to access it
  https://www.bankofamerica.com/smallbusiness/ 
  https://www.bankofamerica.com/login/  
  https://www.bankofamerica.com/accounts/

    if ders a problem we ar able to understand it , in the backend  we will create monitoring dashboard  to mk sure the links ar up n running 
Monitoring dashboards :

if they are unable to access these links if ders  u'll get this 
https Errors and httpsError codes:
  httpStatus codes:
  400 errors = client side errors  
    401 = not authorised  
    402 = permission denied
    403 = forbidden
    404 = not found 
  500 errors = server side errors  
    501 / 502 / 503 =  mayb the server is down
  200 = in the 200 family means its ok  
  300 = redirect 
     mylandmarktech.com/live  ---> zoom  , this wil redirect to our zoom meeting
