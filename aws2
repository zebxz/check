AWS Global Infrastructure Map
-----------------------------
The AWS Cloud spans 102 Availability Zones within 32 geographic regions around the world,
with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and 4 more AWS Regions in Canada,
Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand

what is a region? .... Region  are Logical names  =   
Availability ZONES - AZs   = Physical locations comprising of 
                            one or more ISOLATED Datacenters  

 Regions: us-east-1  = N-Virginia  
          us-east-2  = Ohio  
          us-west-1  = N. California
          us-west-2  is  Oregon 

Regions covers: USA, Canada, Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, Middle East,   
                Australia, 

Can a Lagos based company serve clients around the world with the help AWS ? yes  

in each regon there are diff azs, the azs are engineered to be independent from each other , e.g us east1a is located independently from us east1b

Regions: us-east-1  = N-Virginia, there are 6 azs in this region
  Availability ZONES :  
    us-east-1a --- Arlington
        jenkins-master            9:20 place my jenkins servers in diff az

    us-east-1b --- Fairfax
      jenkins-slave1 

    us-east-1c --- Loudoun 
      jenkins-slave2

    us-east-1f --- Prince William
      jenkins-slave3


11:00 ADVANTAGES OF PLACING MY SERVERS IN DIFF AZS
1) Availability zones - AZs are engineered to be independent from each other
2) A disaster in one cannot/shouldn't affect another AZ.  
   Floods
   earthquake 
   Network failure  
   wildfire

Examples os aws services: ec2 / efs elastic file sys / eks elastic kubernetics serv / ecs elastic container services / iam, identity & access mgt / route53 / elb  

What to consider before creating/hosting resources in aws:
What to consider before choosing a region in AWS:

Regions covers: USA, Canada, Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, Middle East,   
                Australia, 

Can a Lagos based company serve clients around the world with the help AWS ? yes  
for this to happen, This company will need server resources/services [ec2] from AWS
This company will need AWS container resources/services [eks, ecs, ecr, ] 
NB: Not all aws services are found in all aws regions.

What to consider before choosing a region in AWS to launch a service or services:

1)Availability: elastic cloud compute [ec2]   Not all aws services are found in all aws regions, so we hv to mk sure its avail in the region b4 we launch it
              elastic kubernetes service = EKS 
   us-east-1   = 
   af-west-1   = 

2) High Availability:  having multiple servers for your applicaction to avoid application outage
  DEPLOY AN Application server  
   1 application Server  : architecture1  .... you can be a cloud architect, can advice the coy that we cannot hv one app server, so lets hv more than 1 app servers
   4 application Servers : architecture2

hIGH availability can be ACHIEVED BY:
      1. Multiple instances of the servers -- 4 = us-east-1a  
      2. Deploy using Multi AZs = us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, us-east-1f  
      3. Deploy using Multi Regions  = us-east-1, VIRGINIA, us-east-2, OHIO, af-west-1,   
      4. Multi-cloud -- AWS/GCP/AZURE

 Cloud Service Providers = 

3) Latency: -- TIME taken TO ACCESS A SERVER/application 
   us-east-2 = Ohio     --- 200ms to access    1
   us-west-2 = Oregon   --- 100ms to access    2   .. THE best
   af-west-1 = CapeTown  -- 500ms to access    3  

4) cost:                          latency              base on cost  
   us-east-2 = Ohio     --- 200ms to access    1    $4/hr  THE BEST
   us-west-2 = Oregon   --- 100ms to access    2    $8/hr 
   af-west-1 = CapeTown  -- 500ms to access    3    $6/hr 

5) customer Location: IF MY cx AR IN LOndon i will place resources to where the cx are
   Ohio           = us-east-2 = Ohio  
   London         = eu-west-2 = London 

6)Complaince / Regulations []: this cud restrict a coy,, e.g in china , chinese based coys ar adv to only choose datacenters within AS/china,, so u cant choose a dif location
when the govt regulations doesnt permit it

7)Security:
  Mosco /  

####38:55 Cloud Service Providers - CSP = AWS / GCP / AZURE 
CSP[AWS] Provides computing services / resources 
including; servers, network, storage, security, etc. 
over the internet from their Datacenters        

EC2-Basics
==========
  Basic Computer vs      aws-EC2 :
  OS     ----            AMI (OS + Additional Softwares) 
  Hard Drive             EBS (Elastic Block Store)\
  RAM                    RAM
  CPUs[1, 2, 16 core]    Instance type[t2.mirco, t2.medium]
  Network CARD           IP Addressing 
  Firewall               Security Groups

AMI = amazon machine image 

###### EC2 Instance Purchasing Options:
  on-demand instances   = most expensive and very flexible, servers can be created & deleted any time, u pay for services whrn servers ar running
           this is gud for studies bc its d only option that supports for free tier bc u ar always expected to terminate ur instabce               studies 

  Reserved instances    =  ,, #####read note, u reserve inatance & u dnt use it u stil pay 4 it, cx can ask for instances to be reserved
this is gud for deploying to prodution    production 
  
spot instances - Bids =   AWS,, will provide based on avail instances so cx wil place a bid after AWS has placed the offer price
this is gud for testing, like high voltage application

AMI = amazon machine image 

how ARE WE CHARGED FOR EC2.
53:00 instance type is the power of the instance, the specks

e.g  Laptop1: 24 CORES / i9 / 4TB SSD / RAM 128GB  = $9,000 
  Laptop2: 2 CORES / i3 / 1TB HDD   / 8GB       = $700 

AMI = amazon machine image 
      comprises of the OS and other softwares and settings  
  Linux [redhat / centOS / ubuntu / amazonLinux2 / Debian 11 /etc
          Amazon Linux 2 / ]  
  WINDOWS

58:00####things to consider b4 choosing an AMI, THERE ar 3option to choose from
what is in the:
1)Community AMIs: comprises mostly the OS only  
                Generally free 

2)Marketplace AMIs: comprises of the OS and other Licence Softwares 
   splunk -- Amazon Linux 2 + splunk Softwares    
   openvpn --- Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS + 
               Ubuntu 18 LTS

10GB/S   = 10,000MB/S  

3) my AMI = Golden AMIs  :
         
1:01:42 splunk enterprise is used to monitor our servers

1:07:14 t3.2xlarge up to 5 gitabit per sec for band width i.e the internet speed
   vCPUs          RAM      Bandwidth speed  
  c5.metal  96     x86_64  192G  - - 25 Gigabit/sec  
  t2.micro  1      x86_64  1G    - - Low to Moderate

security group is firewALL in front of the server
james an admin/engineer wil access/launch the server by ssh on port 22, while 
paul nids to acces some web content on the server by using http on port 80
for any of them to access this server on our firewall we hv to open http 80 and ssh22  

storage is called ebs volume, after security groups, we configure stored
the speed for hdd is 10 times slowervthan ssd
1:19:25  for volume type, magnetic is like a floppy disk wich use to be used many yrs ago, we dnt nid it,,, so we go for general purpose ssd .. gp3
then launch the instance


INF ABOUT METADATA:  
Metadata: Data about data            data about the instance
- id         = i-08b0ba39aca738105
  privateIP  = 172.31.27.50
  publicIP   = 54.187.238.209  / 54.149.128.80   
  DNS-private= ip-172-31-27-50.us-west-2.compute.internal
  
  dns-public = ec2-54-187-238-209.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
               ec2-54-149-128-80.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

what is my ipaddress
1:26:00 it is more secured to configure my ssh22 for a specific person by selecting the/my ip adress in the drop down box option in the security groups.
outbound rules : all ports are open , so frm the server we can talk with everybody but nt everyone can talk wit us 
security groups are firewalls in front of ur server & security groups are stakeful bc its assigned or attached to a particular instance

1:28:00 IP addresses : see notes


login to your server within your VPC) virtual private cloud/Network     :
  We can use private-IP/orDNS   
  ssh -i aws33.pem ec2-user@172.31.27.50       
  ssh -i aws33.pem ec2-user@ip-172-31-27-50.us-west-2.compute.internal  

login to your server from external Networks     :
  We can use public-IP/DNS 
  ssh -i aws33.pem ec2-user@54.187.238.209      
  ssh -i aws33.pem ec2-user@ec2-54-187-238-209.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com


When we stop a server the rivate-IP/DNS address cannot changed at restart 
When we stop a server the public-IP address will changed at restart ,,bc the ip address is released once we stop the server
  use an elasticIP to maintain a static public-IP even after restart 

########Ticket044 = Create a and install a webserver in aws...... webapp can be used to serve some web content
with the help of ec2 intance we are able to create servers and connect to them

userData - This is a script that can run while creating/launching the server  
========
 #!/bin/bash
 sudo hostnamectl set-hostname web  
 sudo yum install httpd -y 
 sudo systemctl start httpd
 sudo systemctl enable httpd 
 sudo echo "<h1> Welcome To LandmarkTech </h1>" >> /var/www/html/index.html
 sudo echo "<h1> DevOps is good </h1> " >> /var/www/html/index.html

inbound rules  to ssh tcp port 22 access from only my ip address and - description cecilia ssh access... or no description
then http tcp  from 80 - description web access
for users from anywhere in the world https tcp 443
for outbound we allow access from everwhere

######### IQ: How many Security Groups can be assigned to an Instance --- 10   
      sg1_ssh
      sg2_http  
#### after configiration - advancd details:on user data ,inside the big box paste the bash shell script to b able to install apache webservr, so if i 
access it on the webserver, i shud be able to see wlc to landmark

11:57#####then launch the instanc

####21:00  in AWS we hv tesla vpc is a large netwrk with 2 small networks
sutnet1 is public  (with a webserver1) and subnet2 is private with an (app server1).... both in the same ntwrk,, for both to communicate with each oda they can use the
private ntwrk address
we hv another engr chidi in a diff ntwrk, he can access the webserver wit the webser pub ip
also if we hv another webserver2 & appserver in another netwrk, for them to communicate with appser1 & appser2,, they wil use the public ntwrk address


### key implication for web security & user privacy  when a webserver exclusively uses port 443 ,for all its traffic bc we aware that port 80  wil hv some unencrypted
traffic but for sensitive info for data base &user inf is it adviceable to open port 80

the diff btw the http & the htp secured protocol
