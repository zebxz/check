aven has Quality Gates, checking that test cases passes before  packages created.  :
  IQ:1. Assuming that 699 Testcases passed and 1 fails, 
        what can be done for  maven to still do a build? 
           mvn package -DskipTests
           mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true

    2. Some projects are taking long to build how can we resolve the issue:?
       By skipping the test goal with
           mvn package -DskipTests
           mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true  

mvn package: 
  1. validate - 2min 
  2. compile  - 5min
  3. RunUnitTesting [700Run, 699passed, 1failed] =  50min 
  4. create the packages [jar/war/ear]

mvn package 

3. What problems have you faced in your project recently? 
=========================================================
  Maven taking longer than expected time to build artifacts.
  Maven uses plugins and dependencies to validate,
  compile, RunUnitTests and creates artifacts. 
    These plugins and dependencies are located in either:
    1. MavenLocalRepo  or
    2. maven-remote-repo or
    3. maven-proxy-repo or 
    3. Maven-central repo  
  Pulling plugins and dependencies from mavenLocalRepo give    
  the best/fastest Results regarding time. 
  Maven-local-repo was accidentally deleted by a Jr. Engineer

How are java based web applications deployed??
   Are deployed in Tomcat/JBoss servers 

How are java based stanalone applications deployed??
   java -jar app.jar   

How are java based Enterprise applications deployed??
   Enterprise applications Are deployed in JBoss servers  

mvn install: 
  1. validate - 2min 
  2. compile  - 5min
  3. RunUnitTesting [700Run, 699passed, 1failed] =  50min 
  4. create packages [jar/war/ear] in the target directory  
  5. install

I'm managing federated web & Enterprise micro-service applications
for fintech clients 

Enterprise applications with over 21 modules
      1.  MavenEnterpriseApp-ear  
      2.  MavenEnterpriseApp-web  
      21. MavenEnterpriseApp-ear  

How can a Specific module be built in maven-enterprise-applications ?

    mvn  package -pl MavenEnterpriseApp-web
  
    mvn  package -P profilename
      MavenEnterpriseApp-ear  
      MavenEnterpriseApp-web  
      pom.xml
  mvn package -pl MavenEnterpriseApp-web  
  mvn package -P MavenEnterpriseApp-web   

   Artifacts management:
     Maven-local-repo   -- maven server
     maven-remote-repo  -- nexus server

   Plugins/dependency management:
                        location
   Maven-local-repo   -- maven server
   maven-remote-repo  -- nexus server 
   maven-proxy-repo   -- nexus server
   maven-central-repo -- apache maven/internet   

How can we trouble-shoot a fail build IN MAVEN? 
   Check the logs to understand the Errors 
   mvn -X package (BUILD in debugging mode)
 What is the function of Tomcat -->

 What do we consider in selecting dependencies-->?
     Type of project -- we manage java projects 
                        log4j, JUNit, selenium  
==========================================================
1. Maven is a java based open source build tool  
2. Maven can be install on any platform [Linux/Windows/macOS, Solaris]
3. The Maven server must have atleast 2GB of free space for maven to run.  

4. With maven packages can be created by running the commands below:
     mvn package  
     mvn install 
5. Maven uses plugins and dependencies to validate, compile, test and to Build

6. Java1.8+ must be running on the maven server before maven can work.

7. maven will create jar, war and ear packages for stanalone, web and enterprise applications
   respectively  
8. Maven will search for dependencies and plugins from :
      1. mavenLocalRepo   
      2. mavenRemoteRepo  
      3. mavenProxyRepo  
      4. maven central repository
