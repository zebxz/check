AFter commit the codes by developers the next thing is to build

6:30 when you execute mvn package which is uploading the artifacts into the maven default repo, for this packages to be executed what happens in the background is that maven 
extends it functinality      ........... ??? incomplete statement
it uses pluggins and dependencies to do a build




******** mvn package ecompasses of the other default goals ie mvn validate, mvn compile , mvn test
so its better to execute mvn package which is faster compared to running each other


***** to deploy java based stanalone applictaions java must be installed 
java must be installed (java here neabs java must be running)

1)ls target/
copy our maven standalone -app
cp target/maven-stanalone-application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar               ***** app.jar, this is just a placeholder it can be any name you choose)
ls
we can see app.jar (a copy of our standalone-app)
to deploy  = java -jar app.jar    (place holder, app.jar )



******* maven has quality gates ie checking that test cases passes before packages are created

maven has Quality Gates, checking that test cases passes before  packages created.  :
  IQ:1. Assuming that 699 Testcases passed and 1 fails, 
        what can be done for  maven to still do a build? 
          ****** by default maven wont do a build, it will inform us that somthing is wrong 
          Also we can decide that since 699 testcases passed and i failed we should proceed with the deployment

24:15   but what can be done for maven to still do a build if a (1)test fails
           mvn package -DskipTests OR mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
           This will skip the testing processing

    2. Also Some projects are taking long to build how can we resolve the issue:?
       we skip the test goal   (this may comprise quality)
           by running the test the first time we got to know that 699 passed and i failed, so it is possible for me to skip the test cases
          mvn package -DskipTests
           mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true  


3. What problems have you faced in your project recently? 
=========================================================
  Maven taking longer than expected time to build artifacts.  (this is a serious problem)
 now Maven uses plugins and dependencies to validate,
  compile, RunUnitTests and creates artifacts. 
    so if its taking much time to run the testing, we can skip the testing process

alos These plugins and dependencies are located in either:
    1. MavenLocalRepo  or
    2. maven-remote-repo or
    3. maven-proxy-repo or 
    3. Maven-central repo  


to expedite the process
**** so we can ensure that maven has direct access to maven local repo to be able to get dependencies and pluggins

28:30
pulling plugins and dependencies from mavenLocalRepo give    
  the best/fastest Results regarding time. 
  Maven-local-repo was accidentally deleted by a Jr. Engineer  

if a project is taking longer than expected to execute it could mean that maven is closing from the internet and that takes longer time naturally


maven-web-applications:
=======================
https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/maven-web-application
git clone https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/maven-web-application
 
1) to leave msa  ==cd ..
2) we clone
3) Rename : mv maven -web-application/mwa
4) cd mwa
when we ls: we can see our maven web app, developers have written the project file pom.xml, but we dnt have the target file, we also hv our some file src which is very 
important bc if we are going to do a build the 2files maven is using is the pom.xml and the src

32:00
5) vi pom.xml
6) ls target/ and we have an appliaction called tesla.war
we have deployed this application bc inside our build server we executed mvn clean, this will delete the old builds and create new ones
therefore we have done a build for web application, just incase you are asked to do one 
when we vi pom.xml we can see the final name tesla but its going to create a war package


  examples of web applications (whatever it is it must end with war)
maven-web-app.war
boa-app.war
paypal-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
app.war
tesla-web app.war


                        **** WE ARE going to look at tomcat & JBOSS when we are talkingabout web applications 
IQ:
HOW ARE JAVA BASED web applications deployed??

ANS:
Are deployed in Tomcat/JBOSS servers
if you want to deploy a maven web application, we need a maven software installed like tomcat/OR JBOSS


IQ:
for maven to know which package to create its a function of our project
when we vi pom.xml we can see our packing indication? war


How are java based enterprise applications deployed??
enterprise application are deployed in JBOSS servers


39:00 mvn install goal


41:00  in target dir an artifact was created called tesla.war

 mvn install: it will
  1. validate - 2min 
  2. compile  - 5min
  3. RunUnitTesting [700Run, 699passed, 1failed] =  50min 
  4. create packages [jar/war/ear] in the target directory  
  5. the package has been created in target dir but we are installing the packages in maven local repository
       ls/home/ec2-user/.mlr/com/mt/maven-web-application/0.0.2
  so we have the artifacts created in the maven dir and we also have the artifacts backed up in the maven local repo

linux command  rm -rf but mvn clean is better
mvn clean will delete the artifacts in our target dir but will not delete the artifacts in maven local repo
mvn clean will delete everyfile in target dir 

**** this is how web applications are managed



Maven Enterprise applications:
  MavenEnterpriseApp-ear.ear
  MavenEnterpriseApplication.war

https://github.com/mylandmarktechs/maven-enterprise-application
git clone https://github.com/mylandmarktechs/maven-enterprise-application


1) cd..
2) clone
3) mv maven-enterprise-application/meapp
4) cd meapp
5) tree

in the tree we can see the parent pom.xml below while the child pom.xml above in the tree are 2

52:00
to view child pom.xml = cat maven enterprise App- web/pom.xml
when your in a parent pom.xml you will see a parent tag

since we have our project files written by developers we can build 

6) mvn package 

we have 2 modules when we run ls
1) maven enterprise App-ear 
2) maven enterprise App-web pom.xml

ls maven enterprise App-ear = we see pom.xml src target
ls maven enterprise App-ear /target/ = application.xml maven-archive 
                                          maven enterpriseApp.ear

 
53:00  so when you have an enterprise app it will create a .ear file principally

also
ls maven Enterprise App-web/ = pom.xml src target
ls maven enterprise App-web/target/ = maven Enterprise Application.war       test-classes


53:30
so if you create Enter Application by default it will come with many modules

1:32:17 
the child pom.xml is referring to the parent which means thers can of an intersection, so when you run mvn build all those pom.xml will be ultilized


  

---------------
How are java based web applications deployed??
   Are deployed in Tomcat/JBoss servers 

How are java based stanalone applications deployed??
   java -jar app.jar   

How are java based Enterprise applications deployed??
   Enterprise applications Are deployed in JBoss servers

I'm managing federated web & Enterprise micro-service applications
for fintech clients 

Enterprise applications with over 21 modules
      1.  MavenEnterpriseApp-ear  
      2.  MavenEnterpriseApp-web  
      21. MavenEnterpriseApp-ear  

How can a Specific module be built in maven-enterprise-applications ?

    mvn  package -pl MavenEnterpriseApp-web
  
    mvn  package -P profilename
      MavenEnterpriseApp-ear  
      MavenEnterpriseApp-web  
      pom.xml
  mvn package -pl MavenEnterpriseApp-web  
  mvn package -P MavenEnterpriseApp-web   

   Artifacts management:
     Maven-local-repo   -- maven server
     maven-remote-repo  -- nexus server

   Plugins/dependency management:
                        location
   Maven-local-repo   -- maven server
   maven-remote-repo  -- nexus server 
   maven-proxy-repo   -- nexus server
   maven-central-repo -- apache maven/internet   

How can we trouble-shoot a fail build IN MAVEN? 
   Check the logs to understand the Errors 
   mvn -X package (BUILD in debugging mode)
 What is the function of Tomcat -->

 What do we consider in selecting dependencies-->?
     Type of project -- we manage java projects 
                        log4j, JUNit, selenium  
==========================================================
1. Maven is a java based open source build tool  
2. Maven can be install on any platform [Linux/Windows/macOS, Solaris]
3. The Maven server must have atleast 2GB of free space for maven to run.  

4. With maven packages can be created by running the commands below:
     mvn package  
     mvn install 
5. Maven uses plugins and dependencies to validate, compile, test and to Build

6. Java1.8+ must be running on the maven server before maven can work.

7. maven will create jar, war and ear packages for stanalone, web and enterprise applications
   respectively  
8. Maven will search for dependencies and plugins from :
      1. mavenLocalRepo   
      2. mavenRemoteRepo  
      3. mavenProxyRepo  
      4. maven central repository
