   **check ..3 ?? 

AFter commit of the codes by developers the next thing is to build

6:30 when you execute mvn package which is uploading the artifacts into the maven default repo, for this packages to be executed what happens in the background is that maven 
extends it functinality      ........... ??? incomplete statement
it uses pluggins and dependencies to do a build




******** mvn package ecompasses of the other default goals ie mvn validate, mvn compile , mvn test
so its better to execute mvn package which is faster compared to running each other


***** to deploy java based stanalone applictaions java must be installed 
java must be installed (java here neabs java must be running)

1)ls target/
copy our maven standalone -app
cp target/maven-stanalone-application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar               ***** app.jar, this is just a placeholder it can be any name you choose)
ls
we can see app.jar (a copy of our standalone-app)
to deploy  = java -jar app.jar    (place holder, app.jar )



******* maven has quality gates ie checking that test cases passes before packages are created

maven has Quality Gates, checking that test cases passes before  packages created.  :
  IQ:1. Assuming that 699 Testcases passed and 1 fails, 
        what can be done for  maven to still do a build? 
          ****** by default maven wont do a build, it will inform us that somthing is wrong 
          Also we can decide that since 699 testcases passed and i failed we should proceed with the deployment

24:15   but what can be done for maven to still do a build if a (1)test fails
           mvn package -DskipTests OR mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
           This will skip the testing processing

    2. Also Some projects are taking long to build how can we resolve the issue:?
       we skip the test goal   (this may comprise quality)
           by running the test the first time we got to know that 699 passed and i failed, so it is possible for me to skip the test cases
          mvn package -DskipTests
           mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true  


3. What problems have you faced in your project recently? 
=========================================================
  Maven taking longer than expected time to build artifacts.  (this is a serious problem)
 now Maven uses plugins and dependencies to validate,
  compile, RunUnitTests and creates artifacts. 
    so if its taking much time to run the testing, we can skip the testing process

alos These plugins and dependencies are located in either:
    1. MavenLocalRepo  or
    2. maven-remote-repo or
    3. maven-proxy-repo or 
    3. Maven-central repo  


to expedite the process
**** so we can ensure that maven has direct access to maven local repo to be able to get dependencies and pluggins

28:30
pulling plugins and dependencies from mavenLocalRepo give    
  the best/fastest Results regarding time. 
  Maven-local-repo was accidentally deleted by a Jr. Engineer  

if a project is taking longer than expected to execute it could mean that maven is closing from the internet and that takes longer time naturally


maven-web-applications:
=======================
https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/maven-web-application
git clone https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/maven-web-application
 
1) to leave msa  ==cd ..
2) we clone
3) Rename : mv maven -web-application/mwa
4) cd mwa
when we ls: we can see our maven web app, developers have written the project file pom.xml, but we dnt have the target dir, we also hv some files & dir; src dir which is very 
important bc if we are going to do a build the 2files maven is using is the pom.xml and the src
5) mvn package
ls 
we now have a target dir
32:00
6) vi pom.xml
7) ls target/ and we have an appliaction called tesla.war
we have deployed this application bc inside our build server we executed mvn clean, this will delete the old builds and create new ones
therefore we have done a build for web application, just incase you are asked to do one 
when we vi pom.xml we can see the final name tesla but its going to create a war package


  examples of web applications (whatever it is it must end with war)
maven-web-app.war
boa-app.war
paypal-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
app.war
tesla-web app.war


                        **** WE ARE going to look at tomcat & JBOSS when we are talkingabout web applications 
IQ:
HOW ARE JAVA BASED web applications deployed??

ANS:
Are deployed in Tomcat/JBOSS servers
if you want to deploy a maven web application, we need a maven software installed like tomcat/OR JBOSS


IQ:
for maven to know which package to create its a function of our project
when we vi pom.xml we can see the archive file/packing indication? jar OR war OR ear



How are java based enterprise applications deployed??
enterprise application are deployed in JBOSS servers


39:00 mvn install goal ......   
the package will be  created in target dir and also, we are installing the packages in maven local repository; ie the .mlr repo" we created earlier
BUT mvn package ONLY creates the package in target dir 

**** explanation:
41:00  in target dir an artifact was created called tesla.war

 mvn install: it will
  1. validate - 2min 
  2. compile  - 5min
  3. RunUnitTesting [700Run, 699passed, 1failed] =  50min 
  4. create packages [jar/war/ear] in the target directory , however it doesnt end ther.
  5. the package has been created in target dir but when we install, we are installing the packages in maven local repository; ie the .mlr repo" we created earlier.
  so we have the artifacts created in the maven dir and we also have the artifacts backed up in the maven local repo  ... 42:12
 ls/home/ec2-user/.mlr/com/mt/maven-web-application/0.0.2-SNAPSHOT    ie the .mlr repo" we created earlier

linux command  rm -rf but mvn clean is better
mvn clean will delete the artifacts in our target dir but will not delete the artifacts in maven local repo
mvn clean will delete everyfile in target dir 

**** this is how web applications are managed



Maven Enterprise applications:
  MavenEnterpriseApp-ear.ear
  MavenEnterpriseApplication.war

https://github.com/mylandmarktechs/maven-enterprise-application
git clone https://github.com/mylandmarktechs/maven-enterprise-application


1) cd..
2) clone
3) mv maven-enterprise-application/meapp
4) cd meapp
5) tree

in the tree we can see the parent pom.xml below while the child pom.xml above in the tree are 2

52:00
to view child pom.xml = cat maven enterprise App- web/pom.xml
when your in a parent pom.xml you will see a parent tag

since we have our project files written by developers we can build 

6) mvn package 

we have 2 modules when we run ls
1) maven enterprise App-ear 
2) maven enterprise App-web pom.xml

ls maven enterprise App-ear = we see pom.xml src target
ls maven enterprise App-ear /target/ = application.xml maven-archive 
                                          maven enterpriseApp.ear

 
53:00  so when you have an enterprise app it will create a .ear file principally

also
ls maven Enterprise App-web/ = pom.xml src target
ls maven enterprise App-web/target/ = maven Enterprise Application.war       test-classes


53:30
so if you create Enter Application by default it will come with many modules


what do we consider in selecting dependencies .................................  ????????????
type of project - we merge java projects 
                              log4j, Junit , selenium       ****** we can see our project dependencies in maven local repo

   ***** maven local repo can be located in .m2/repository but this location can be changed in settings pom.xml




55:00 
IQ: 
IN managing federated web and enterprise micro- service applications for fintech clients 

An enterpriseapplication with over 21 modules

how can a specific module be built in maven-enterprise application
for example, developers have done a change in module one 

 by passing the PL flag                ..........  ?????
mvn package -P1 profile name
mvn package - P1 maven enterprise -web
mvn package - P maven Enterprise -web

57:45
if there are many modules but cahnge in only one module 
we build by choosing that particular profile
by using the ? web flag



1:16 
FOR ARTIFACT  to be created maven has to be installed and for us to be able to pull clone the codes from github, in our build server we hv to yum install git 




59:30
  by default maven is going to be bilding using artifacts 

** Artifacts management : artifacts are stored in maven local repo in our maven servers

 Artifacts management:
     Maven-local-repo   -- maven server
     maven-remote-repo  -- nexus server

   Plugins/dependency management:
                        location
   Maven-local-repo   -- maven server
   maven-remote-repo  -- nexus server 
   maven-proxy-repo   -- nexus server
   maven-central-repo -- apache maven/internet   



1:32:17 
the child pom.xml is referring to the parent which means thers can of an intersection, so when you run mvn build all those pom.xml will be ultilized




  1:00 
how can we trouble -shoot a fail build in MAVEN ??
Check the logs to understand the errors
mvn - x package (BUILD in debugging mode) This will build in debugging mode 


1:24 there are some issues i can TS as a devops engineer AND there are some issue i will escalate to the developers that this build is not responding pls correct them 
accordingly or pls modify the project file ie pom.xml


1:24:54

if you are doing a build and you are not doing it in the project file the build will fail or in a diff dir it wont work 
you must be in the project directory 



what is the function of tomcat
