Ticket077: Search for a file called list
find = search for files and directories  
searching a file in the user's home Directory:
   find /home/ec2-user -name fileName or find ~ -name fileName 
   find /home/ec2-user -name list  or find ~ -name list  
searching a file in the present working Directory:
   find /home/ec2-user/dev -name list   or   find . list     

searching a file in the root Directory: 
sudo -u root find / -name fileName
  find / -name list 
  sudo -u root find / -name list    
  sudo find / -name list  
[ec2-user@demo dev]$ sudo -u root find / -name list
/sys/kernel/debug/error_injection/list
/sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/list
/home/ec2-user/dev/list
/home/ec2-user/list



Assignment:
Assign permission for the dominon user to read the blessed.me file

chmod 600 filename
chown = use to change file ownership
chgroup = use to change file group ownership


chmod +r fileName :  gives evryone permission to read
the correct code = chmod 604 fileName  


********************
obi will be working on the blessed.me for this sprint, 
please grant ownership of the file to obi  
This practice is good for automation and easy deployment
of tasks/workloads. 

ANS:
chown newOwner fileName   
chown obi blessed.me    
[ec2-user@demo ~]$ chown obi blessed.me
chown: changing ownership of 'blessed.me': 
  Operation not permitted
This is because:
chown and chgroup commands can ONLY be run by the rootUser
sudo is a command used to run commands as another user  

**************  therfore the correct command : 
sudo -u root chown obi blessed.me 
    sudo chown obi blessed.me  
sudo -u obi  chown obi blessed.me      

before you run the command mk sure the owner is running the command  ( i bliv chown without sudo , u hv to be rootuser)
[ec2-user@demo ~]$ sudo - u root chown obi blessed.me   OR  sudo chown obi blessed.me



***********     TO change group ownership

[ec2-user@demo ~]$ sudo -u obi  chgrp obi blessed.me
chgrp: cannot access 'blessed.me': Permission denied

sudo chgrp obi blessed.me
