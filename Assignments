Ticket077: Search for a file called list
find = search for files and directories  
searching a file in the user's home Directory:
   find /home/ec2-user -name fileName or find ~ -name fileName 
   find /home/ec2-user -name list  or find ~ -name list  
searching a file in the present working Directory:
   find /home/ec2-user/dev -name list   or   find . list     

searching a file in the root Directory:

Assignment:
Assign permission for the dominon user to read the blessed.me file

chmod 600 filename
chown = use to change file ownership
chgroup = use to change file group ownership


chmod +r fileName :  gives evryone permission to read
the correct code = chmod 604 fileName  


********************
obi will be working on the blessed.me for this sprint, 
please grant ownership of the file to obi  
This practice is good for automation and easy deployment
of tasks/workloads. 

ANS:
chown newOwner fileName   
chown obi blessed.me    
[ec2-user@demo ~]$ chown obi blessed.me
chown: changing ownership of 'blessed.me': 
  Operation not permitted
This is because:
chown and chgroup commands can ONLY be run by the rootUser
sudo is a command used to run commands as another user  

**************  therfore the correct command : 
sudo -u root chown obi blessed.me 
    sudo chown obi blessed.me  
sudo -u obi  chown obi blessed.me      

before you run the command mk sure the owner is running the command  ( i bliv chown without sudo , u hv to be rootuser)
[ec2-user@demo ~]$ sudo - u root chown obi blessed.me   OR  sudo chown obi blessed.me



***********     TO change group ownership

[ec2-user@demo ~]$ sudo -u obi  chgrp obi blessed.me

2. We need a server with java & maven installed and configured

    mkdir java-projects  
4. Clone the codes from github in the project directory

1) to leave msa  ==cd ..
2) we clone
3) Rename : mv maven-web-application/ mwa
4) cd mwa
when we ls: we can see our maven web app, developers have written the project file pom.xml, but we dnt have the target dir, we also hv some files & dir; src dir which is very 
important bc if we are going to do a build the 2files maven is using is the pom.xml and the src
5) mvn package
ls 
we now have a target dir
32:00
6) vi pom.xml
7) ls target/ and we have an appliaction called tesla.war
we have deployed this application bc inside our build server we executed mvn clean, this will delete the old builds and create new ones
therefore we have done a build for web application, just incase you are asked to do one 
when we vi pom.xml we can see the final name tesla but its going to create a war package


  examples of web applications (whatever it is it must end with war)
maven-web-app.war

to view child pom.xml = cat maven enterprise App- web/pom.xml
when your in a parent pom.xml you will see a parent tag

since we have our project files written by developers we can build

we have 2 modules when we run ls

crteate custom netwrk
deploy in the custom bridge netwrk
deploy in the host netwrok
create docker null/none netwrk


DOCKER8&9
Deploy the database image with a docker volume   ..... Docker home dir :  DHD = /var/lib/docker
Deploy the database image with an external volume
install docker compose
deploy an application with a docker compose file , should include a custom bridge netwrk & a piece of docker vol or external vol
***i bliv the netwrk can be already existing ie before creating the compose file,we can create it using command & then inside the compose file we indicate
'true'


DOCKER10
install docker swamp
Deploy a stack, it will create an overlay netwrk so i dnt need to create any netwrk like in docker/docker 8&9 assignement
but this stack should include a vol
*** meee** deploy using a compose file this will have the 'deploy strategy' that has the 'replica option'

KUBERNETES
1&2
 **** meee*** we want to setup/install/ deploy a multi node cluster ,, he didnt use userscript in AWS but used installation script in mobaxterm
Ticket 001:  .. always remember to use my own token ...............            53;12
  Setup a multi nodes self Managed kubernetes cluster using kubeadm.
  requirements -- 

1. check the kubernetes official documentation  :
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/

2. check the company's documentation for kubeadm setup    : 
https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/package-management/blob/master/kubeadm/READme.md

*******************in our env, we v created github repo, n we v summarized this REQuirement there, evrytin i nid to deploy my cluster is xplained ther

3)create master node & 2worker nodes

ticket002
Deploy workloads in kubernetes;
***ignore, its just about k8 objects used for deployment


Ticket3:
kubernetes uses the kubectl client or the UI to run workloads.

           ****I can practice only Since its not recommended to deploy in using pod as an object
 therefore in the manifest file, kind will be 'rc' & we will also hv a template for pod inside the same manifest file & if we need to create service, we wil
                        also have a template/section for service

Ticket4          **i bliv all these is in the master node
1)CREATE FINTECH & ECOMMERCE NAMESPACES (fintech) USING IMPERATIVE APPROACH  (COMMAND)
2) Create (prod) namespace using the declarive approach (manifest file)
3)Create (dev) namespace using the imperative approach (command)
4)USING DECLARATIVE APPROACH (MANIFEST FILE), deploy the manifest file to create a pod call it 'myapp', in the 'dev' namespace
(remember the manifest file with create a container, call the container 'app')
 


KUB 3&4           ***continues with KUB 1&2
Ticket
1)set configured namespace (dev)to current namespace/context
2)create service type CLUSTERip  called (chatr) for the pod(myapp which is in the dev namespace)
3) using command, create pod called 'hello' in the default namespace using the '-n default' command
4)Uisng the exec -it command; Apply FQDN  command to est communication btw the pod in the dev namespace (called myapp) & the pod in the default 
namespace (called hello)    *** for now i dnt know if it will work without the 'exec' command
5)Using command, create pod  called 'dollar' in the 'dev'namespace
6)Est communication btw the 2pods (myapp & dollar) in the dev namespace uisng just the service name (chatr)
8)Use manifest file to create a STATIC POD
9) use a manifest file to create a replica controller that will be recreating the pod (webapp) with container (web) & will also create a NODEPORT service  
10) create a docker SECRET, use the secret in the manifest file to deploy/create REPLICA SET that will be recreating the pod (billion) & will also create a 
NODEPORT service .....   ***we need the SECRET to be able to successfully pull the image from a private repo which we use in the manifest file 



KUB 5 ... Class34
2)Deploy with demon set   so that each pod is scheduled/deploy on all the nodes ie node1 and node9
3)Taint a node
3)add toloration to tainted node

4)Ticket6:
========
Explain the kubernetes objects recommended to ensure the scheduler schedule a pod  
in each node or a group of selected node/nodeGroup


Ticket7:
--------
Provide a lecture on how pods can be scheduled on tainted nodes.
In Kubernetes we use tolerations to schedule pods on tainted nodes.  


KUB 6  ... CLASS34

1)Deploy using recreate strategy
2)Deploy using rolling update strategy
3) UPdate deployment with set image


Ticket 007:      *** we didnt treat this in this video, dnt know why it was in his rolling notes scripts
  Setup a multi nodes kubernetes cluster using the kops software.

Ticket 017:
  Setup a kubernetes cluster using the amazon EKS? .

Ticket 019:
  Instal tree, unzip, git and nano in a windows system and an ubuntu.



KUB 7
1) Create a resource request & limit

KUB 7b
1)Deploy an application/pod & Auto scale the application/pod with a HPA, &a service for the cluster autoscaler** this will include to install a metrix server
where the deployment will be done & a install a HPA, which will auto scale the application

**** He only deployed with HPA, he didnt deploy with VPA & CAS



KUB 8&9
CAn we use NFS TO scale inorder to meet the wrk load??
if u are refering to hw to hv multiple read replicas 
we wil be seeing hw to replicate the db so we can hv multiple read replicas

***mee** when we do, i will confirm if we introduce the nFS vol or any type of vol first before we replicate/autoscale or replictate/autoscale first before
introducing NFS 
in Kub7, in the HPA illustration, he autoscaled a diff application but when he started kub vol concept in kub8&9, he didnt continue with the same application
from kub7

Ticket
1)Deploy the legacy appication with their diff service type ie springboot mongo with nodeport service & mongo db with cluster ip service
2) we deployed d database with diff vols; we deployed mongo db with hostport vol & mongo db with nfs vol , doesnt require a manifest to create a service type
    *dnt know why we didnt create a manifest file to create a service, i bliv he just skipped that part bc we did in kub 10&11

** i can ignore task no.2 & go straight to no.3&4 task since vol with PVC is the recommended method
3)Deploy mongo db with hostport based PVC  .. this will include 3manifest files the PV,the PVC & the mongo db appl
4)Deploy mongo db with nfs based PVC  ... this will include 3manifest files the PV,the PVC & the mongo db appl

***skip all, deploy will kops kub 10&11




Kub 10&11

1)Deploy an application with configmap & secret using delacrative approach
2)change service type in a file from nodeport to loadbalancer ,..... ignore just an illustration to show disadvantage of self managed cluster
3) Install kops
4) Deploy the legacy application using kops
KOPS create a storage class, so we dnt need to create a PV, we create only a PVC Claim





KUB 12; nginx-ingress       **mee*based on the info below form kub 10&11, we only need nginx for a self manged cluster, which requires me to create a lb ie the 
                                               nodeport(app) or clusterip(database) service type which does loadbalancing for us
1) Deploy nginx ingress controller
2) deploy an application with nginx service
paths
3)create Arecord for the application hostbased routing & for the application pathbased routing
4)Create & deploy ingress rule for the application hostbased routing
5)Create & deploy ingress rule for the application pathbased routing

  **kub 10&11
managed or self managed  LB 
if i create a self mangaed lb, wit the self managed LB, i may create a server n in the server, i wil install a software like ngnix afterwich it wil deter hw 
service is routed, we might also need nginx for EKS cluster to reduce cost of lB
self managed =
   NGINX   




KUB 13  EKS  Installation



KUB 14        HELM

1)Install Helm 3  Architecture
2)Deploy a custom application of ours by creating the manifest/helm charts & push the chart to the repo
b)upgrade the application ie use v2 or 3 of the image
c)change the service type of the application (this wil include creating Arecord in AWS & create the ingress rule)
3)Deploy the application of ours by cloning the chart we pushed to the repo
4)Deploy ngnix using helm



KUB 15
Probes



kuB 16
Install & deploy promethus & grafana using helm  (the deployment will include an alert manager)
create a record & ingress rule for promethus/grafana & alert manager
Deploy nginx
deploy applications to see how nginx routes traffic to them & also see how promethus/grafana can be used to visulaize/see how the applications in the cl8 are performing
I think he didnt create A record for the applications bc they arent our focus/ he didnt try accessing them online
But i may need to create it




KUB 17
applying some commands
1)Access an application that is running

install EFK/ELK stack using helm
should be able to acces kibana externally
create A record & ingress rule for kibana
create host base routing ingress rule for kibana
 HOST BASE ROUTING INGRESS RULE FOR KIBANA



KUB 18                SECURITY
               EKS cl8 was deployed using terraform..

 this is the link for the elk/terraform project ... https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/elk-with-terraform/blob/main/README.md
iluustrate RBAC using EKS  ie create an EKS cluster & use it to illustrate how to use RBAC 
1)CONFIGURE ROLES & CLUSTER ROLES TO PERMIT WHO CAN PERFORM DUTIES IN OUR K8 CLUSTER, 
2)AWS IAM CONSOLE CREATE GROUP,  ENSURE AWS CLI IS INSTALLED, 
3)CONFIGURE THE CONFIGMAP TO AUTHORIZE USER, 
4)CREATE ROLE, 
5)BIND ROLE TO USER, DEPLOY AN APPLICATION, 
6) MK THE USER GET ACCESS TO SVC, 
7) MK THE USER GET ACCESS TO READ ALL THE SERVICES,




                                                                TERRAFORM
1) Install Terraform, either using package manager or download terraform binary
2) for code editor, install vs code editor
3) Create aws instance using resource block
 ****objective is to see that we have to pass the AMI region in the provider to avoid getting an error
4)
