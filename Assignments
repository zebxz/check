Ticket077: Search for a file called list
find = search for files and directories  
searching a file in the user's home Directory:
   find /home/ec2-user -name fileName or find ~ -name fileName 
   find /home/ec2-user -name list  or find ~ -name list  
searching a file in the present working Directory:
   find /home/ec2-user/dev -name list   or   find . list     

searching a file in the root Directory: 
sudo -u root find / -name fileName
  find / -name list 
  sudo -u root find / -name list    
  sudo find / -name list  
[ec2-user@demo dev]$ sudo -u root find / -name list
/sys/kernel/debug/error_injection/list
/sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/list
/home/ec2-user/dev/list
/home/ec2-user/list



Assignment:
Assign permission for the dominon user to read the blessed.me file

chmod 600 filename
chown = use to change file ownership
chgroup = use to change file group ownership


chmod +r fileName :  gives evryone permission to read
the correct code = chmod 604 fileName  


********************
obi will be working on the blessed.me for this sprint, 
please grant ownership of the file to obi  
This practice is good for automation and easy deployment
of tasks/workloads. 

ANS:
chown newOwner fileName   
chown obi blessed.me    
[ec2-user@demo ~]$ chown obi blessed.me
chown: changing ownership of 'blessed.me': 
  Operation not permitted
This is because:
chown and chgroup commands can ONLY be run by the rootUser
sudo is a command used to run commands as another user  

**************  therfore the correct command : 
sudo -u root chown obi blessed.me 
    sudo chown obi blessed.me  
sudo -u obi  chown obi blessed.me      

before you run the command mk sure the owner is running the command  ( i bliv chown without sudo , u hv to be rootuser)
[ec2-user@demo ~]$ sudo - u root chown obi blessed.me   OR  sudo chown obi blessed.me



***********     TO change group ownership

[ec2-user@demo ~]$ sudo -u obi  chgrp obi blessed.me
chgrp: cannot access 'blessed.me': Permission denied

sudo chgrp obi blessed.me

1) Ticket_maven-001    .....  ***************** DONE
Install Maven on a RedHat Linux 9 Server  

2. Java is a pre-requisite for maven to run 
    JRE --> JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT
    JDK --> JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT 1.8+
            JVM will also be installed      (once java is installed, this installs automatically)

 43:30
we already hv some notes in our githubwhich we can use for maven installation , package management, maven installation


mavenHomeDir = M2_HOME = /opt/maven :


STEP4 :

SEt environmental variable for specific user eg ec2-user
ls -a  /home/ec2-user/
vi ~/.bash_profile    and add lines below
export M2_HOME=/opt/maven
export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin



STEP5: 
    Refresh the profile and verify if maven is running
source ~/.bash_profile
  To see if maven has been installed: mvn - version



2)Standalone Applications
Ticket_saa_tesla0014  
===================
Requirements:
1. project repository in the SCM [GitHub / GitLab]
   https://github.com/Landmark-Technologies/maven-standalone-application       ********** our repo from our source code mgt is in github
2. We need a server with java & maven installed and configured   
3. Create a project directory in the maven/build server
    mkdir java-projects  
4. Clone the codes from github in the project directory  
   git clone https://github.com/Landmark-Technologies/maven-standalone-application         ********  this means that developers have written code and committed to github
     src/main  
     src/test


3)maven-web-applications:
=======================
https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/maven-web-application
git clone https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/maven-web-application
 
1) to leave msa  ==cd ..
2) we clone
3) Rename : mv maven -web-application/mwa
4) cd mwa
when we ls: we can see our maven web app, developers have written the project file pom.xml, but we dnt have the target dir, we also hv some files & dir; src dir which is very 
important bc if we are going to do a build the 2files maven is using is the pom.xml and the src
5) mvn package
ls 
we now have a target dir
32:00
6) vi pom.xml
7) ls target/ and we have an appliaction called tesla.war
we have deployed this application bc inside our build server we executed mvn clean, this will delete the old builds and create new ones
therefore we have done a build for web application, just incase you are asked to do one 
when we vi pom.xml we can see the final name tesla but its going to create a war package


  examples of web applications (whatever it is it must end with war)
maven-web-app.war
boa-app.war
paypal-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
app.war
tesla-web app.war



4)Maven Enterprise applications:
  MavenEnterpriseApp-ear.ear
  MavenEnterpriseApplication.war

https://github.com/mylandmarktechs/maven-enterprise-application
git clone https://github.com/mylandmarktechs/maven-enterprise-application


1) cd..
2) clone
3) mv maven-enterprise-application/meapp
4) cd meapp
5) tree

in the tree we can see the parent pom.xml below while the child pom.xml above in the tree are 2

52:00
to view child pom.xml = cat maven enterprise App- web/pom.xml
when your in a parent pom.xml you will see a parent tag

since we have our project files written by developers we can build 

6) mvn package 

we have 2 modules when we run ls
1) maven enterprise App-ear 
2) maven enterprise App-web pom.xml

ls maven enterprise App-ear = we see pom.xml src target
ls maven enterprise App-ear /target/ = application.xml maven-archive 
                                          maven enterpriseApp.ear
