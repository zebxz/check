ANSIBLE INTRODUCTION, types of config tools, INSTALLATION, PREREQUISITE, TERAFRM SCRIPT TO CREATE RESOURCE, USING 2 DIFF SCRIPT AS USER DATA ON AN INSTANCE, 
ASSOCIATE/CREATE A KEY,  ANSIBLE_config_file



 today we start a new serie of ANible
so far we hv been working with terfrm , its a tool we use for infrastrure prvisoining
we sue trtfrm to provion/create infrastrure

 but we hv anoda tool we call Ansible 
this is a tool we wil use for configuration , like after you cretaed your infrastyrure how do you configure it , how do you install software 
e.g you may log into an ec2 instance or maybe at work theres a package thats missing , you nid to insatll mayb an apache server
already you an the instance running but ur suppose to instal some software inside of it, that process of dinstalling that paticular software is what is called configuration
mgt 
when you patch a sevrer, you update a server, your nt creating the server, you are basically configuring it
when you instal jenkins on a server your not creating jenkins ec2 instance , your configuring it , thats the process thats called configuration mgt
so as we look at config mgt we wil be looking at ansible

 1) we wil be looking at key concepts 
this is just involves you defining what ansible is 

  What is Ansible?
How ansible works.
What are the benefits of Ansible?

  ****at an interview they might ask you
 or  your suppose to implement it in your organisation, how wil ypu sell it, ho wwill you convince your org that they need ansible
so you need to understnad,what is is , how it wrks and its benfits to an org

 2) we will see the process of hw to install ansible and we will be able to have a script to install ansible on our ubnuntu server

3) we wil look at the ansible config file. like hw do u configure ansible 
once you install the ansible software in an ec2 instance then it gets to a point wher you need to configure it, hw is this ansible goin to automate process

then ansible will be working with what is called managed nodes, so we woil look at hw w eacn configure mged nodes
how we can use ansible to be able to patch other servers, to be able to configure other servers , we will look at how we can configure that

4)  we will look at Ahod commands 
like when you run now commands in ansible , we hv commands that you can run on the command line , what we call adhod commands but we wil also see that we can use playbooks

5) we will look at what ansible roles are 
6) dynamic inventory 
 and finally
7) ansible vault


   but for tonight we go over the introduction, try and install ansible and see hw we can configure some managed nodes or remote nodes using ansible

      WHAT IS ANSIBLE 

 Ansible is an open-source configuration Management, deployment and provisioning Automation tool maintained by Redhat. the vendor 
It is very, very simple to setup and yet powerful.
Ansible will be helpful to perform:
Configuration Management
Application Deployment  e.g we can use it to deploy in k8, w ecan write a playbook that we can use to deploy in k8
Task Automation  , we can automate task just by using ansible 
IT Orchestration


    How Ansible works

Ansible works by connecting to remote nodes (hosts) and pushing out small programs, called “Ansible modules” to them.
e.g you hv your ansibleserver, this is the server wherby you hv installed your ansible software on this ec2 instance as such this is my control node, ansible controller 
bc its the server that have installed my ansible server and afteri have that i can hv multiple remote nodes, i can hv other ec2 instances/servers  one can be a window server,
the other a redhat server , then what ansible does is , am able to control this multiple servers frm my control node thru ssh connection 
once it has a ssh connect it connects to remote host (the windowd and redhat servers) it is goin to push small programms into your nodes this programs are what we are caling
modules , it pushes your ansible modules insid eof theservers that ist controlin, once that is done, the module wil perfrom a task, lets say i want to create a file inside 
of this so i can use ansible to go insid ef this ec2 istance n create a sile so it sgoin to use a file module, it wil push the file module over ssh , once its moved , ansible 
wil use the file module to create that file accoridng to the specifictaion, once it creates the file it deletes the module and once it accomplishes that task , it masrks that
task a complete and then it deletes the module   . 

   **********10:48
 on the window server, i can push a program that will congigure the server an donce its done the module is taken out
this is how ansible does 


The pushed programs/modules will be executed on remote server by Ansible over SSH and removes them when finished.
Unlike Puppet or Chef it doesn’t use an agent on the remote host, Instead Ansible uses SSH. It is agentless.
It’s written in Python which needs to be installed on the remote host.
This means that you don’t have to setup a client server environment before using Ansible

   INTERVIEW QUESTION
 what other configurtaion mgt tools do you know ??

ANS: 
 Apart from ansible, puppet , chef is also a configuration magt tool 
this two uses agent on the remote host while ansible uses a push mechanism and thats why ansible stands out 
ansible pushes modules so its your controller that initiates, it pushes out modules so it doesnt need agents in your seververs
unlike puppet and chef that need an agent bc the use a pull module an dbc they use a pull mechanism as such you have to install a puppet agent of a chet agent inside of 
each node bc it is the agent that will initiate that particular push bc your controller will be pulling. it uses a pull mechansim when it does the configuration
so ansible stand sout bc it doesnt need an agen , it uses a push mechanism as such its agentless 


  ******* bc ansible is written in python thefrore python needs to be installed on your remote node bc ansible runs on python so the firtsthing is python needs to be 
installed on the remote node for ansible to wrk , so this menas you dnt ned to setup a client server env before before using ansible 
all you need to do is setup your ansible server then inside of your configuration file which w ecall the host file , you just need to pass the ip address of the 
particular server that you wnat to patch or confgure then ansible will take care of that so you dnt have to do any setup on these particular servers
so thats basicllay how ansible works


    INTERVIEW QUESTIONS 

Benefits of using Ansible

It is a free open -source Automation tool and simple to use.
Uses existing OpenSSH for connection ,    modt o THE servers taht we provison already hv open ssh configure so ansible jsut uses thsi  for it to do configuration
Agent-less – No need to install any agent on Ansible Clients/Nodes
Python/YAML based                        .... playbooks are written in yaml language n yaml are very easy, so ansible is easy to use 
Highly flexible and versatile in configuration management of systems.
Large number of ready to use modules for system management  ,  ansible community and redhat they hv a whole lot of module thst sre resdy to be ued
                                so u dnt need to create or re write anything just use the existing module, we hv a lot of modules that comes preloaded when u install ansible
Custom modules can be added if needed        


******** just knw what ansible is, knw how it works, once you knw how it works you are able to present this in an interview , you are able to easily talk abt ansible just
based on this and the benefits

so if your wroking for a coy that doesnt use ansible yet and you wnat to convince them , may they are alwys patching servers, alwasy sshing into servers manually to do
configuration then you can introduce a configuration mgt tool as ansible 


   17:32 
     HOW DO YOU INSTALL ANSIBLE
   Ansible is designed to run on Unix/Linux systems, therefore Windows systems aren’t supported for the control node.
 this means that the control node has to be either linux or unix for ansible to be installed once it is isnstalled, it can controll the remote nodes whethr windows 
so  a conrol node cannot be windows but tonight installation we will be installing it on a redhat 
for maco s, the operating system is linux , if you have mac then you can run ansible directly frm your mac bc thats a linux env
but on windows laptop, you cant directly run ansible on ur windows server u hv to create an ec2 instance or what is called a windows subsistence of linux,  wsl , mayb ubuntu
or contos os then you can for sure install ansible and run lt locally 
bt for our case we will run ansible on an ubuntu sever

Ansible is python based and therefore the control node and the managed nodes need to have python2 or python3 installed on them.
******* the good news is that most of our system already cm with python installed bt also ansible once it connects to a system, if python isnt already installed,its goin to
install python basically 

Ansible can be installed in three ways:

Using yum or apt       ******** if ur installing on ec2 instance
Using pip              ****** package manger for python
Using compile file       **** download / use a complie file     ****  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html 
                                in the link u can see hw w e ar able to install ansible



   ****** we are installing ansible on ubuntu , meaning it will be our control node 


  NO.1
******* 21:44              PREREQUISITE TO INSTALL ANSIBLE 

 ###########  Installing Ansible on Ubuntu

  $ sudo adduser ansible                   ***** 1st u need to create a user who willl install ansible, this user will install the ansible software
  $ echo "ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansible       ********* we add him to sudoers group , for sudo right bc he will be installing packages
  $ sudo su - ansible                                      ****** switch user to ansible 
  $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible            ****** once ansible is installed in our env,,always remeber ,the user that instal the sf ware is the default user
  $ sudo apt install ansible -y                                                                                 ansible who ansible will be expecting to connect with 
       

                                   ****** if hv installed this user a sansible and hv installed ansible sfware as an ansible user then when am making an ssh connection by
     default ansible my in my control node wil be looking for a user in the remote node called ansible 
########thats smt u really need to pay attention to and understand how it works ############
         a user who installs the sfware, it is the default user that ansible expects in the remote host bc when u do ssh connection , do so ssh to a aspecific home of a user
e.g thet why we do ssh ,then ec2 @ a certain ip  OR ssh you pass the key, then u do ubuntu @ we are always trying to do ssh to a certain user, default user
  ********* then for ansible if we hv install ansible as an ansible user then this ansible user becomes the default user that when you do ssh ,anible here(control) will be
seeking to connect with a user in the remote 
25:41
    if i install ansible in the control as a user called Ken, then my default user in the remote that ansible will be looking to connect with will be a user called ken
bc that becomes the default user in ansible , this is how e can install ansible on ubuntu



##############  Ansible installation on REDHAT EC2                  the same when installin on redhat
           thi script will use pip bc its goin to use yaum to install python and pip , then il use pip to install ansible as the user bc hv done sudo -su a sthe user

  $ sudo useradd ansible 
  $ sudo hostname ansible 
  $ echo "ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansible 
  $ sudo su - ansible # Enable PassowrdLogin and assign password to ansible user 
  $ sudo yum install python3 -y 
  $ sudo alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3 
  $ sudo yum install python3-pip -y 
  $ pip3 install ansible --user


   26:46 ***** 
          then once have installed asible thers a script here for our remote nodes , then rmember the default user ansible wil be looking for is a user called asnible
it means on my remote node, i need to have a user called ansible that am setting as the default so that when asnible pushes the module, it is pushing to home of this
ansible and it is this ansidible user in the remote node that will do the installation/patch work 

NO2.
###### Script to add user, password and enable password authentication

#!/bin/bash
$ sudo useradd -d /home/ansible -s /bin/bash -m ansible    ********  it is pushing to home of this ansible and it is this ansidible user in the remote node
$ sudo echo "ansible:ansible" | chpasswd                   *** giving the user PW and the PW is ansible 
$ sudo echo "ansible  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansible              ******** addding user in sudoer
$ sudo sed -i "/^[^#]*PasswordAuthentication[[:space:]]no/c\PasswordAuthentication yes" /etc/ssh/sshd_config       **PW authentication needs to be enabled inside sshd config
$ sudo service sshd restart


 28:45 ******in summary, bc hv installed ansible in the controller as asnsible , bc hv installed as uer there as ansible , i need to create aa user in the remote called ansible
this is the suer that ansible in the controler wil be pushing this remote nodes to 
the system with the remote node has to hv PW authentication enabled bc if this is a linux sysytem,(the remote node sys) linux sys by default has been designed to communicate 
using ssh keys and therfror PW authentictaion by default has been set to false, ur nt allowe dto use a PW , bt sinec we are creating a user in the remote sys, for you to be 
able to transfer a key, you will need to transfer a key (aagin ull see when we cm to authentication) to a particular user bt ull need to use a PW for the key to be transferd

*****29:52
    Right now am goin thru the overview, so once you guys get the big picture we will go into the actuall installation
so the reason why we nid the ansible user in the remote node sys is so that we can transfer a key to them, after wich we can do ssh without a PW, wich we will see passwordless
authentictaion 


  NO.3   ************       INSTALLATION
 
  30:50 ######## lets go ahead with the Installation
so again as i said , at this stage we wil be using automation
so inside of this Ansible dir, i provided for you some terfrm code , we will use trfrm to easily create our resources
https://github.com/LandmakTechnology/Ansible-mc-series/tree/main/01-Introduction/terraform%20files

   ####### a)   data.tf
thers a data source for our ubuntu server , to get our ubuntU AMI 
thers also another data to get our redhat bc am creating both ubuntu and redhat server for host 

######## b)   ec2.tf
   ***** then for our ec2 , the first resource am creating is for ubuntu server 
  this ubuntu server the AMi is using a data source which is for  ubuntu 
the instance type am passing it as a variable , looking at the variable file it is t2.micro (default)
for user data am pasing a script, d same script that i showed your guys to instal asnible on that particular ec2 instance , so am using that same particular script (NO.2) for
installing ansible on that ec2 insatnce (the script is the file we hv called ansible-install-ubuntu)
 
********* 32:53 bt apart frm that, i also have anoda script which i will talk to you guys abt 
  apart fr m that script, i have 2 scripts that i want to provison, i wnat to configure my instance with 

.......... Bi)           control node 
   #resource block
resource "aws_instance" "ubuntu" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = var.my_instance_type
  #user_data     = file("${path.module}/ansible-install-ubuntu.sh")
  user_data = data.template_cloudinit_config.user-data.rendered

  key_name = var.my_key

  tags = {
    "Name" = "Ansible-Ubuntu"
  }
}
  

   ********* 32:53 bt apart frm that, i also have anoda script which i will talk to you guys abt 
  apart fr m that script, i have 2 scripts that i want to provison, i wnat to configure my instance with

  33:16   USING 2 DIFF SCRIPT AS USER DATA ON AN INSTANCE

    INTERVIEW QUESTION
How can you pass 2scripts as user data ???? 

ANS:

 because of how very flexible terfrm is, it gives you that opportunity to do that through what is called a datasource called :

    "template_cloudinit_config"    , its a template that you can use , he called it (name) 'user-data'

......... Bii) part of  ec2.tf

  data "template_cloudinit_config" "user-data" {
  part {
    content_type = "text/x-shellscript"                                     ********* for content type am passing a shell script
    content      = file("${path.module}/ansible-install-ubuntu.sh")
  }
  part {                                                        ********but am passing again a 2nd script 
    content_type = "text/x-shellscript"                           ****** 2nd part again here the content is a script, 
    content      = file("${path.module}/vscode-install.sh")       ***** d content is anoda ascript that i wil use to instal vscode inside of my ubuntu
                                                                  so that when we start writing playbooks, we can actually write playbks and run them at the same time
   instead of us vi ing, writing play bks on our ide here then copying , then goin to the ubuntu an vi , create a file and do all that  .... 
 so am installing this vscode inside of my ubuntu , so thats the script that am using, the script is called (vscode -install.sh)

  35:00
      #######  C)                       #(vscode -install.sh)

   sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https wget -y
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main" -y
sudo apt install code -y

in the script am just doin  sudo apt update 
am installing the sfware .. wget
it is getting the repository for vscode
and am using apt to install vscode which is what is called vscode   , so it will install it frm the apt repository 


   so thats what am doing with this user data, (Bi) bc am using 2scripts 
  
user_data = data.template_cloudinit_config.user-data.rendered

** **** if its one script, ill just pass it like this: file
               #user_data     = file("${path.module}/ansible-install-ubuntu.sh")

but bc its more than 2, if your given 3scripts, 4scripts, that you need to install then ull have to use a data source called :template_cloudinit_config

 36:14 ####### once we have this configured, then we ill run our ansible 
now for the host, those that we are goin to manage, like our host 
am also creating 2ubuntu instances and am creating them as the ones we will use as nodes to manage, as our managed nodes
and am using count meta argument , and the name and the type .. this is a meta argument that we knw 
and on this insatnces am using user data but on this user data, am just passing a file
    
 ....... Biii)   ec2.tf

    "Type" = "My-Ubuntu-${count.index}"
  }


    ## ## D
    create ansible user

THIS file is to create a user, am creating d ansible user inside of my host am also enabling PW authentication dynamically 
am running a script to enable PW authenticataion, to chngae it fmr no to yes in the etc ssh sshd_config
then am goin to start the service

   #!/bin/bash
sudo useradd -d /home/ansible -s /bin/bash -m ansible
sudo echo "ansible:ansible" | chpasswd
sudo echo "ansible  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansible

sudo service sshd restart


37:37                  ........... continued above
******* 
this 2 servers that am provisioning as my ubuntu am goin to create that user in them n also create an instance
create a user enable PW authentication and all that 

****38:06
AM also creating a redhat
am using a redhat AMI
the instance type is the same 
but in this redhat am just ceatimng a user same user as this (Biii) bc i wnat to be ablr to manage both ubuntu and redhat 
so Biii and Biv are my manged nodes while  Bi) is the control node 
******* my control node am installing ansible and am installing vscode on them 
 and Bii) is my data block to run the 2scripts (to install ansible and vscode) 
  
......... Biv)

*****   38:25
so with this, i have outputs , i have set my outputs, its just goin to get

  ###### E)
                   Outputs.tf

   ubuntu public ip 
    value       = aws_instance.ubuntu.public_ip

also for the redhat
  value       = aws_instance.rhel-hosts[*].public_ip



   ********39:17
 remember bc am using count , count returns  alist therfor i can output, i can acces values frm a list
thats why when u do an output if you havant passed this list [+] , it will say the instance you are trying to access has 3 or more attributes and its attribute has to be
accessed at a specific instance, this is what it means, 
so whenevr you are trying to output you need to pass {} and put in either 0 or 1 , a specific instance 
but fo rthis redhat resource blk, i only have one count , so i can eith put 0 or a splar or wildcat *, it wil just return the ip of whatever instance is there

   
   ******  am also getting the private ip 
     value       = aws_instance.rhel-hosts[*].public_ip

 all these are what we call attributes, attributes out of that particular instance 


41:05
   ####### F)        provider.tf

 *** this is smt you are familiar with
this is the 2nd half of the file i copied

#provider block
provider "aws" {
  region  = var.aws_region
  profile = "default"            ***********my profile ma just using default bt again i dnt hv to pass that profile there bc its default, bc its default then its just goin 
                                                                to pick that by default

######### G)
   variables.tF


NO.4)

    **********41:40

WITH That, i have my terafrm  set

now in the IDE terminal (like mobaxterm )
am inside of the terrafrm files (i bliv dir)
if i ls i see all the files 
so  let me run terfrm init
this is the first command you are to run 
you can run init as many times a spossible , it initializes your backend 

  initializes the bcakend 
here my backend is local bc in my terfrm, i didnt pass any s3 bucket
so with this ill run trfrm format ,just to mk sure my code is formatted correctly

terrfrm plan
so the firts tin it does, it runs your data sources
so that template data , it reads the user data
then it goes out to fetch the ubuntuand redhat AMI, and it returns them , those are the ids
we see the user data 

terfrm apply -auto-approve                  ..... 44:48
then it starts provisioning my instances 
he logs into AWS
we see 4 instances that has just been created running 
1)my-rhel -0                **** created  Ansible user
2)my ubuntu -1              **********created  Ansible user
3) Ansible-ubuntu   ,       ************ where i installed the ansible software using the script
4) My-ubuntu-0              ********* created Ansible user


################# H)         ASSOCIATE/CREATE A KEY

   ******47:06

lets go ahead and connect to the ansible server (ANsible-ubuntu)
clicks connect , copy the ssh command 

  ########## one other thing i forgot to mention is that bc we will b sshing into the server so mk sure you create/associate a key
so i had already ahd a key created and on my ec2, i had passed this key name: key_name = var.my_key  as seen in ( Bi, Biii, and Biv) 
and in the variables.tf  (G) 

   variable "my_key" {
  type    = string
  default = "ansible-key"            ******** the key name is ansible-key , this is the key that uve created (shud hv already created)in your aws console
}

  in his aws key pairs
i created the key, i donwloaded the .pem keybut this key here is the public key that always remains in AWS, that is installed inside of ec2 instance when you provisoin
so you download the private key but the public key remains inside of your instance and that show authentiaction happens 




********* 48:22
     N0.4 continues

so when we go to our ansible-ubuntu and try to connect (click connect) the ill use ssh client then copy the ssh command
back in the IDE, ill split my terminal 
cd into downloads bc thats wher my key was downloaded
then il paste the ssh command 
am trying to conncet to this instance for the first time
my env is linux bc am using a mac , mac is linux
so am trying to connect a linux sys to a linux sys
lets see what will happen 
 after pasting the command, its asking , are you sure you want to continue connecting yes/no
once i type yes , enter
now am connected
it did conncet me bc i alrady change the permission of the key 
so if ur doing it for the firts time it wil give you an error that your key is open 
so whwn your connecting a linux to linux then you need to change the permission of the key to  400
you need to use change mode 400 the your key name  (chmod 400 key-name)
if your connecting from a linux env to another linux env 
but bc i did it already , the key.pem i already changed the permission to 400 thats why its allowing me to connect

let see if our script ran 
sudo su - ansible 
so yes, i see that ansible user was created , i hv a home of anisible , thers a user called ansible
