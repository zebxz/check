today we stsrt a new serie of ANible
so far we hv been working with terfrm , its a tool we use for infrastrure prvisoining
we sue trtfrm to provion/create infrastrure

 but we hv anoda tool we call Ansible 
this is a tool we wil use for configuration , like after you cretaed your infrastyrure how do you configure it , how do you install software 
e.g you may log into an ec2 instance or maybe at work theres a package thats missing , you nid to insatll mayb an apache server
already you an the instance running but ur suppose to instal some software inside of it, that process of dinstalling that paticular software is what is called configuration
mgt 
when you patch a sevrer, you update a server, your nt creating the server, you are basically configuring it
when you instal jenkins on a server your not creating jenkins ec2 instance , your configuring it , thats the process thats called configuration mgt
so as we look at config mgt we wil be looking at ansible
