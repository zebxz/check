today we stsrt a new serie of ANible
so far we hv been working with terfrm , its a tool we use for infrastrure prvisoining
we sue trtfrm to provion/create infrastrure

 but we hv anoda tool we call Ansible 
this is a tool we wil use for configuration , like after you cretaed your infrastyrure how do you configure it , how do you install software 
e.g you may log into an ec2 instance or maybe at work theres a package thats missing , you nid to insatll mayb an apache server
already you an the instance running but ur suppose to instal some software inside of it, that process of dinstalling that paticular software is what is called configuration
mgt 
when you patch a sevrer, you update a server, your nt creating the server, you are basically configuring it
when you instal jenkins on a server your not creating jenkins ec2 instance , your configuring it , thats the process thats called configuration mgt
so as we look at config mgt we wil be looking at ansible

 1) we wil be looking at key concepts 
this is just involves you defining what ansible is 

  What is Ansible?
How ansible works.
What are the benefits of Ansible?

  ****at an interview they might ask you
 or  your suppose to implement it in your organisation, how wil ypu sell it, ho wwill you convince your org that they need ansible
so you need to understnad,what is is , how it wrks and its benfits to an org

 2) we will see the process of hw to install ansible and we will be able to have a script to install ansible on our ubnuntu server

3) we wil look at the ansible config file. like hw do u configure ansible 
once you install the ansible software in an ec2 instance then it gets to a point wher you need to configure it, hw is this ansible goin to automate process

then ansible will be working with what is called managed nodes, so we woil look at hw w eacn configure mged nodes
how we can use ansible to be able to patch other servers, to be able to configure other servers , we will look at how we can configure that

4)  we will look at Ahod commands 
like when you run now commands in ansible , we hv commands that you can run on the command line , what we call adhod commands but we wil also see that we can use playbooks

5) we will look at what ansible roles are 
6) dynamic inventory 
 and finally
7) ansible vault


   but for tonight we go over the introduction, try and install ansible and see hw we can configure some managed nodes or remote nodes using ansible
