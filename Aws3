??? couldnt mount efs

###IOS- INPUT OUTPUT per sec
When a server is created, ders a piece of storage attached to it, wich is mounted on the server n its called ebs , block store n its has an advantage ie it is elastic 
7:10 #####not clear its going to be mouning among others within a root file system..

the block storage is unique, bc the ebs on webserver1 cannot be transferrd to webser2 bc they ar blocked to the server   

????? for vol settings whats the diff btw general purpose ssd2 and ssd3 
??????  sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins ..... why the -p

storage solutions:
  ebs volume  = block store
       Required mounting    
       
  efs  volume = file storage
       Required mounting 
       sudo yum install nfs-utils
     
  s3 bucket   = object storage 

[ec2-user@web ~]$ lsblk  .... list block command to list the blocks,,, in the lsblk command, we hv our root file system... ie xvda1
NAME      MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
xvda      202:0    0   8G  0 disk......... jst one disk & its a block store 21:50
├─xvda1   202:1    0   8G  0 part /
├─xvda127 259:0    0   1M  0 part
└─xvda128 259:1    0  10M  0 part /boot/efi

#######16:57 for my file sys i can also execute df -h, we can see xvda1 is mounted on our root file system ie /dev/xvda1

Root [/] directory has other sub-directories
  /bin /home /etc/ /var /opt / ... this is a root file system

Ticket0048:
  Create, attached & mount 5G to the /tesla directory 
  Create, attached & mount 7G to the /var/lib/jenkins directory 

files ar mounted frm d root dir bc /root is wher all oda dir starts bt can i create a specific storage for /teslas? yes

the volume to be created can be as large as 16 terabyte
#38:00 volume state says volume is available so i can attach d vol to an instance , then vol stae changes to in use. can also modify vol by inresing its size bt cant decrea
we can modify while volume is in use
##42:14 we can increase from 14gb to 18GB ie VERTICAL increase, 
mounting is attaching to the server so dat files can be saved on the file system

#https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html
Creating ebs volume    
Attaching EBS  
Mounting ebs:
 to know the file sys  ,, ie if it has any file or jst an empty dvf
1. sudo file -s /dev/xvdf

to list all file systems
     sudo lsblk -f
 
 to create the file system for the vol
2. sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
    sudo yum install xfsprogs  ... if it says command nt found

 to create a mount point dir for vol3. sudo mkdir /data
    sudo mkdir /app   bt mk sure /app or /data doesnt exists
 
to mount
 3. sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
    sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /data
    sudo mount /dev/xvdf2 /data 

 4. sudo unmount /dev/xvdf /data

Create, attached & mount 7G to the /var/lib/jenkins directory  ... all our jenkins job will be found here

sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdg
 sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins
sudo mount /dev/xvdg /var/lib/jenkins/


$$$$41:09 in aws-jenkins server- actions:image&template 
elastic block:snapshot-crrate snapshot.. all the data in our jenkins server wil backup in the snapshot
after snapshot is crested, in action: we can creatse vol, change the availability zone &when we check in volumes we can see the newly created vol
my original jenkins server was in US west2a bt d vol frm snapshot is in US west2c, & al the data avai in my jenkinsserver is capture in dis snapshot, wich is now in this vol
wich meanas that if i use this vol my life wil b easy bc dis vol already has jenkins installed, so if am tryin to instal jenkins on a new server, if i use dis vol, wud d vol
1:19:35 comes wit jenkins already installed? ... yes bc dis vol that has been created frm my jenkins backup, it has all d softwares.

1:21:10 creating my AMI(amazon machine image) =GOLDEN AMIS
click created snapshot-action-create image frm snapshot-vol cannot be reduced-create-i can go to ec2 instnace &launch a server using the image,&everytin dat was in the
original server wil be in dis new one bc its a bkup, a mirrow of the original server   ....
create instance-myAMIS-owned by me:select the image frm drop box- t2micro

1:36:12 CREATING A LIFE CYCLE FOR MY INSTANCE
1:43 bc we ar running multiple jobs in jenkins ,at evry point in time we shud hv 5 backups, so every 24hrs a backup shud be created,evry 24hrs asnapshot is created
the 5 backups is on the 1st in ist out basis..ie by saturday when it makes the 6th backup snapshot, the snapshot dat it made on monday wil b automatically deleted

TO create a lifE cycle TO CREATE SNAPSHOTS FOR MY JENKINS INSTANCE
life cycle manager-nxt step-instance-target resoure tag:Name &choose tag name frm drop box then add/write tag name-descripption-default role- tag:Name & write tag name-policy
enable-nxt-select time for every- retention max keep-tick copy tag frm source-review policy- create policy

WE CAN equally automate HW the AMI images a re created via life cycle manager


EFS:

Traditional volume mgt and LVM use to require SystemsAdmin  
skills to perform. Today cloud computing skills are required to 
simplify and automate the process

IQ: Explain your experience with AWS Storage services ?
    Explain a project you did which you are proud of  ? --

##1:51 we can have Volume expansion - vertical   [4gb-->7gb] 
Volume expansion - horizontal [v1=8g, v2=7g, v3=6g]  

traditionally in thsoe days,we needed a lot of systems admin,Traditional volume mgt and Logic VM use to require SystemsAdmin  to effects, u nid to b a system admin to 
carry out this stuff, meaning we require systems admin skill to perform ,,  Today cloud computing skills are required to simplify and automate the process

but the interview question is what hv you done when it comes to AWS services, thers a ervice in aws called lamba
Lambda functions:
=================  
  If we have upto  75% volume usage increase vol by 20%   
  
in my envi in one of my projects, i was able to use the lamba function, which was written to expand my project by 20% whenevr usage is 75% 
### 1:54so if  df -h / 100G/75G  ie avail 100 and used 75, increase by 20% --  so we then hv 120G

1:54:2  7we can also  write a lamba function , lamba function has what is called diasaster recover
if u work for landmark and we hv aws account1, we hv a database server running , account 2 
diaster dat can occur , if someelse is able to access d email&paswd & log into aws wit root access, thers a possiblity of a disaster bc dats a serious issue bc they wil hv 
access to all my servers bt wit account 1 & account 2, our disaster recovery is accont 2, wit our database serververs running in account 1, we back the databases in accout2
by creating a snapshot lifecycle policy using Lambda  which
create sonapshots, wich is a replica of account1 from our databases from account1 in account2 cross region , so we ar able to recover frm account2
SO WIT THE HELP OF LAMBDA & snapshot lifecycle policy, this entire process was automated
so am proud of that project


Disaster Recovery:  
 cross account 
    aws account1 = email/password [root access], we nid user name & paswd 
       database servers running   

    aws account2 = email/password [root access]  
      backup database servers in account2 

We created a snapshot lifecycle policy using Lambda  which
create sonapshots from our databases from account1 in account2
 cross region   

### 2:00 efs : file storgae 

efs  volume = file storage / SHARED Storage.. can be shared by one or more srvers or devices
     Requires mounting & we can use a software like netwrk file system
     sudo yum install nfs-utils 

exmaples of file storage 
google drive-has a file storage of 400G = legah@gmail.com  
in the drive , i have files: documents, pictures, videos 
mounted on: phones, tablets, computers  
after it is mounted, so all i nid to do is login to my email then i can access the files.... therefore it can be called a shared storage
we can snap pictures with our phone and acces the pictures on several devices due to shared directory& its possible due to elastic file system

NFS = Network file system(traditionally)  = self managed   
EFS = Elastic File system  = managed by AWS , therfore u hv more time to focus on ur applications
so nowadays managed solutions is what is driving many companies


in the search bar, type efs -name&vpc then create - aws dashbaord-select jenkins server-back to efs:attach-mount via dns- back to jenkins server- mkdir efs- to mount efs:
paste :sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-00727c0c3be6ea5ea.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ efs 
.. if it doesnt mount, ensure nfs port 2049 is open in jenkins server- in NFS- ntwrk:manage-add security group.
2:19;24we can watch ls efs/ in the jenkins ami backup server ^when we touch a file e.g sudo touch test in the main jenkins server, we can see it appear in the backup server 
data can synchronize bc its a shared system  
the only tin we had to do was to instal the nfs client..ie elastic file system
hostname -i to see the diff ip of the diff servers

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple,
 scalable, elastic file system for general purpose 
 workloads for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
  https://youtu.be/AvgAozsfCrY     ... to get some direct inform from aws talking abt efs

  efs  volume = file storage
       Required mounting 
       sudo yum install nfs-utils
       sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0027f3e4b8f8187ee.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/ efs
       
#### what ar the diff storage solution u hv been exposed to as a devops engr
hv been exposed to block storages like ebs volume,v been exposed to file storage like elastic file system, netwrk file sys,google drive etc also object storage like s3bucket


when unmounting an ebs volume thers a command to run to format the drive that deletes the files in the drive sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf, creating a new file system
2:28 to avoid formatting run sudo file -s /dev/xvdf to knw if the drive is pertitioned, so if it is, u then skip the formating step & go ahead to mount it sudo mount /dev/

Ebs is a block storage, it can only be attached to one ec2 instance at a time bc its a block storage, it has to be removed frm one server b4 u can attach it for another server
it is block bc it is assigned
