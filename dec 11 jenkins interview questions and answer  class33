we use maven for build and tomcat for deployment having integrated it with nginx webserver for loadbalancing & routing traffic from endusers to the appservers 
we bring in sonar for security, then nexus aas a repository for backing up our artifacts and jenkins to automate the end to end process (CI/CD)
Most importantantly or in addition to that; because security is inheerent in our environment we utilize AWS for various levels of security like ........
furtheer more we use docker & kubernetes for .....
and finally Ansible and terrfaorm for ..........


jenkin 7&8
someone is aking we hv nt deployed to tomcat ,, we are going to be deploying containerized app, tomcat was an introduction
  1:12:18 all of these is nt happening in one agent , mvn package will tk place in maven build server, sonar,the code quality analysis will talk to a 3rd party server wich is sonarqube server

2:04:00  we can use jenkins for non java applications and any application as expalined in jenkins shared lib video

cloud computing is very imp bc COMPANIES ar migrating very quick &fast from on-prem to cloud we'l be looking at hw aws helps us to manage our infrastructure

with CSP (Cloud Service Providers) like aws, GCP and azure we can pay only for used computing Services

userData - This is a script that can run while creating/launching the server  


, we'l be looking at hw aws helps us to manage our infrastructure
-- 1:28:30 .for our application to be accesed by cx,it nids to be hosted on some computer systems& for that to happen we nid an hardware,on the hardware the OS is instaled
we nid a piece of storage for our database & our appl is running, so we nid to create a data center
Datacenter:
   1. Applications [80%]   = 500MB    #### what is very imp to us is the appl, 1:34:05 our appl can only be held if we hv a piece of storage wich is adequate
   2. Database-storage     = 25000MB = 25GB   
   3. OS  -                = 5000MB  = 10GB .. 1:35:329 ubuntu is 4.6GB 
   4. HardWare
    a computer system comes wit a hardware system, an OS, a storage,IF the OS requires 500mb, we nid a disk space that has up to the volume of 500mb

###### hw do we deploy in tomcat, we copy to webapps .. the tomcat server nids to hv sufficient storage for us deploy the appl successfully
   tomcat = cp target/app.war  /opt/tomcat9/webapps/


Amaka Nwosu  wants to b supplying some financial solutions to cx around the world, for her to start dis coy traditioanlly,she has to buy a coy wit the ryt OS&
storage b4 she can start running her application... this is a challenge so we hv cloud solutions
         AmakaTech
           ---->  WE hv cloud solutions, wit cloud services like aws, we can pay only for what we use

with CSP (Cloud Service Providers) like aws, GCP and azure we can pay only for used computing Services.
Cloud Service Providers    - CSP =e.g  AWS / GCP / AZURE / alibaba/ etc.    
the main cloud service providers :AWS - Amazon Web Services , GCP - Google Cloud platform), AZURE Cloud
 Cloud Service Providers - CSP = AWS / GCP / AZURE 
they Provide computing services / resources like servers, network, storage, security, etc. over the internet from their Datacenters   
   pa

with CSP, we can reduce cost by:
  pay-as-you-go 
  pay-as-you-grow  
  pay-as-you-use

on-prem Datacenter:
     data centers, Own and manage by the user/client  .. #if Amaka acquires everytin hersef, that becomes an on-prem infrastructure bt we can hv some of this services provided to us by
    a cloud provider. 1:40 :48


REQUIREMENTS OF owning a data center:
Dedicated  space
ultra fast internet speed (in todays term)
High  bandwidth superfast INTERNET


 understanding cloud computing is very imp bc COMPANIES ar migrating very quick &fast from on-prem to cloud 
Cloud Service Models:
=====================
IaaS -- Infrastructure as a service  :   has components that is managed by the vendors & managed by us 
e.g ec2 instance  - ec2 
  - SonarQube

PaaS--  Platform  as a service  : aws container registry, aws kubernetes solution
  ECR / EKS / ECS / 

AWS 2

The AWS Cloud spans 102 Availability Zones within 32 geographic regions around the world, 
with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and 4 more AWS Regions in Canada,
Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand

what is a region? .... Region  are Logical names  =   
Availability ZONES - AZs   = Physical locations comprising of 
                            one or more ISOLATED Datacenters  

 Regions: us-east-1  = N-Virginia, us-east-2  = Ohio, us-west-1  = N. California , us-west-2  is  Oregon 


Regions: us-east-1  = N-Virginia, us-east-2  = Ohio, us-west-1  = N. California,   us-west-2  is  Oregon 

Regions covers: USA, Canada, Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, Middle East, Australia, 

Can a Lagos based company serve clients around the world with the help AWS ? yes  

in each regon there are diff azs, the azs are engineered to be independent from each other , e.g us east1a is located independently from us east1b

Regions: us-east-1  = N-Virginia, there are 6 azs in this region
  Availability ZONES :  
    us-east-1a --- Arlington
        jenkins-master            9:20 place my jenkins servers in diff az

    us-east-1b --- Fairfax      us-east-1c --- Loudoun 
      jenkins-slave1               jenkins-slave2


11:00 ADVANTAGES OF PLACING MY SERVERS IN DIFF AZS
1) Availability zones - AZs are engineered to be independent from each other
2) A disaster in one cannot/shouldn't affect another AZ.  
   Floods
   earthquake 
   Network failure  
   wildfire


                EXAMPLES OF AWS SERVICES
 ec2 / efs elastic file sys / eks elastic kubernetics serv / ecs elastic container services / iam, identity & access mgt / route53 / elb  


            WHAT TO CONSIDER BEFORE CREATING/HOSTING RESOURCES IN AWS & BEFORE CHOOSING A REGION IN AWS

Regions covers: USA, Canada, Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, Middle East,   
                Australia, 

Can a Lagos based company serve clients around the world with the help AWS ? yes  
for this to happen, This company will need server resources/services [ec2] from AWS
This company will need AWS container resources/services [eks, ecs, ecr, ] 
NB: Not all aws services are found in all aws regions.


1)Availability: elastic cloud compute [ec2]   Not all aws services are found in all aws regions, so we hv to mk sure its avail in the region b4 we launch it
              elastic kubernetes service = EKS 

2) High Availability:  having multiple servers for your applicaction to avoid application outage
  DEPLOY AN Application server  
   1 application Server  : architecture1  .... you can be a cloud architect, can advice the coy that we cannot hv one app server, so lets hv more than 1 app servers
   4 application Servers : architecture2

hIGH availability can be ACHIEVED BY:
      1. Multiple instances of the servers -- 4 = us-east-1a  
      2. Deploy using Multi AZs = us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, us-east-1f  
      3. Deploy using Multi Regions  = us-east-1, VIRGINIA, us-east-2, OHIO, af-west-1,   
      4. Multi-cloud -- AWS/GCP/AZURE

 Cloud Service Providers = 

3) Latency: -- TIME taken TO ACCESS A SERVER/application 
   us-east-2 = Ohio     --- 200ms to access    1
   us-west-2 = Oregon   --- 100ms to access    2   .. THE best
   af-west-1 = CapeTown  -- 500ms to access    3  

4) cost:                          latency              base on cost  
   us-east-2 = Ohio     --- 200ms to access    1    $4/hr  THE BEST
   us-west-2 = Oregon   --- 100ms to access    2    $8/hr 
   af-west-1 = CapeTown  -- 500ms to access    3    $6/hr 

5) customer Location: IF MY cx AR IN LOndon i will place resources to where the cx are
   Ohio           = us-east-2 = Ohio  
   London         = eu-west-2 = London 

6)Complaince / Regulations []: this cud restrict a coy,, e.g in china , chinese based coys ar adv to only choose datacenters within AS/china,, so u cant choose a dif location
when the govt regulations doesnt permit it

7)Security:
  Mosco /  
     

EC2-Basics
==========
  Basic Computer vs      aws-EC2 :
  OS     ----            AMI (OS + Additional Softwares) 
  Hard Drive             EBS (Elastic Block Store)\
  RAM                    RAM
  CPUs[1, 2, 16 core]    Instance type[t2.mirco, t2.medium]
  Network CARD           IP Addressing 
  Firewall               Security Groups

AMI = amazon machine image 

######                                              EC2 INSTANCE PUURCHASE OPTION, HOW ARE WE CHARGED FOR EC2.
  on-demand instances   = most expensive and very flexible, servers can be created & deleted any time, u pay for services whrn servers ar running
           this is gud for studies bc its d only option that supports for free tier bc u ar always expected to terminate ur instabce               studies 

  Reserved instances    =  ,, #####read note, u reserve inatance & u dnt use it u stil pay 4 it, cx can ask for instances to be reserved
this is gud for deploying to prodution    production 
  
spot instances - Bids =   AWS,, will provide based on avail instances so cx wil place a bid after AWS has placed the offer price
this is gud for testing, like high voltage application

AMI = amazon machine image 

                                       
                                                       HOW ARE WE CHARGED FOR EC2.
53:00 instance type is the power of the instance, the specks

e.g  Laptop1: 24 CORES / i9 / 4TB SSD / RAM 128GB  = $9,000 
  Laptop2: 2 CORES / i3 / 1TB HDD   / 8GB       = $700 

AMI = amazon machine image 
      comprises of the OS and other softwares and settings  
  Linux [redhat / centOS / ubuntu / amazonLinux2 / Debian 11 /etc
          Amazon Linux 2 / ]  
  WINDOWS

58:00####things to consider b4 choosing an AMI, THERE ar 3option to choose from
what is in the:
1)Community AMIs: comprises mostly the OS only  
                Generally free 

2)Marketplace AMIs: comprises of the OS and other Licence Softwares 
   splunk -- Amazon Linux 2 + splunk Softwares    
   openvpn --- Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS + 
               Ubuntu 18 LTS

10GB/S   = 10,000MB/S  

3) my AMI = Golden AMIs  :
         
1:01:42 splunk enterprise is used to monitor our servers

1:07:14 t3.2xlarge up to 5 gitabit per sec for band width i.e the internet speed
   vCPUs          RAM      Bandwidth speed  
  c5.metal  96     x86_64  192G  - - 25 Gigabit/sec  
  t2.micro  1      x86_64  1G    - - Low to Moderate

security group is firewALL in front of the server
james an admin/engineer wil access/launch the server by ssh on port 22, while 
paul nids to acces some web content on the server by using http on port 80
for any of them to access this server on our firewall we hv to open http 80 and ssh22  

storage is called ebs volume, after security groups, we configure stored
the speed for hdd is 10 times slowervthan ssd
1:19:25  for volume type, magnetic is like a floppy disk wich use to be used many yrs ago, we dnt nid it,,, so we go for general purpose ssd .. gp3
then launch the instance


INF ABOUT METADATA:  
Metadata: Data about data/  data about the instance
- id         = i-08b0ba39aca738105, privateIP  = 172.31.27.50, publicIP   = 54.187.238.209, DNS-private= ip-172-31-27-50.us-west-2.compute.internal



When we stop a server the rivate-IP/DNS address cannot changed at restart 
When we stop a server the public-IP address will changed at restart ,,bc the ip address is released once we stop the server
  use an elasticIP to maintain a static public-IP even after restart 

########Ticket044 = Create a and install a webserver in aws...... webapp can be used to serve some web content
with the help of ec2 intance we are able to create servers and connect to them


userData - This is a script that can run while creating/launching the server  


                                     TRANSFERRING FILES OVER THE INTERNET
31.00 after installing webserver 
HTTP = hyper text transfer protocol    = listens on port 80 
HTTPS =  hyper text transfer protocol secured   = listens on port 443 
i can transfer files over the internet in the webserver in CLI so long as the file is in     
34:00  i can transfer files over the internet in the webserver in CLI, E.G redirecting contents frm one file to another, or changing or adding to my web content
HTTPS = hyper text transfer protocol Secured   = listens on port 443  


35.23
the diff btw the http & the htp secured protocol 
the diff btw the http & the htp secured protocol 

                             HTTP                  HTTPS 
Data                     insecured                   secured

####21:00  in AWS we hv tesla vpc is a large netwrk with 2 small networks
sutnet1 is public  (with a webserver1) and subnet2 is private with an (app server1).... both in the same ntwrk,, for both to communicate with each oda they can use the
private ntwrk address
we hv another engr chidi in a diff ntwrk, he can access the webserver wit the webser pub ip
also if we hv another webserver2 & appserver in another netwrk, for them to communicate with appser1 & appser2,, they wil use the public ntwrk address


### key implication for web security & user privacy  when a webserver exclusively uses port 443 ,for all its traffic bc we aware that port 80  wil hv some unencrypted
traffic but for sensitive info for data base &user inf is it adviceable to open port 80


if u launch a server in us east one A , it cant be moved to us east b bc the computer is hosted in us east A,, thats where the hardware is found. cos once u host a server 
you are creating a virtual machine, u hv launced a virtual computer bt they ar running on a physical hardware system which ar located in a specific location
 and those locations ar in data centers,or availability zones, so we can uae data centers  and avail zone to an extent  interghangeable 
you can only choose the aws zone while the instance is being made, bc once a server is hosted u are creating a virtual computer

we wil see the diff classif of aws RES
we hv resources that ar availa zone specific ..ie their scope is within an availa zone 
we also hv resources that their scope is regional and resources that their scope is global


###41:00 the public ip address is optional i.e u can allow ur server be allocated an ip address or nt bt regardless, th eprivate ip adress must be assigned to servers
when u stop the server the pulic ip address is released back to aws and the server is assigned a new pub ip but when we start worjing in coy, we wont hv to stop the server 
bc the uptime of the server is important ie hw long the server has been running
