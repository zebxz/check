Explain your experience with linux system/EXPLAIN YOUR EXPERIENCE IN OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGY
Linux with open source technologies the software is free, including the source code,85% OF our servers are linux based,linux systems are not vulnerable to virux attack, our linux servers are scalable & linux has a very large effective and free community support
LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS 
1) Redhat linux  2) Centos linux   3) Ubuntu linux  4) Suse linux 5) Fedora linux
6) Gentoo linux  7) mandriva linux 8) Debian linux  9) slackware  10) Amazon linux 2AMI 
i have over 7years experience performing various tasks on linux system including:
1) Deploying, provisioning and creating linux servers in Aws cloud and connecting to servers using - ssh protocol
2) configuring , optimising , commissioning (installing packages) and decommissioning (uninstalling packages)and securing linux servers
3) Running workloads in linux servers/systems using:
GUI - console
command - CLI
scripts -  *** mee   (which i will expand on when we get to tools like ;docker, ansible & terrafrom)


EXamples of workoads/task i execute includes:

file mgt: touch ,    (created files, modified files, make direstories, granted persmission, ,....  File editor (windows) sublime text, vim, vscode, eclipse
user mgt: adduser, modify users, defining the scope of users privilidges, assigning paswd, change ownership, granting users permission
process mgt ; top, ps-ef, jobs, kill,bg, fg starting a process, stop/kill a process 
security mgt;  configuring passwd authentication, fierwall (to secure our severs)
package mgt ; installing, update softwares using package managers like yum,apt, rpm (redhat package manager)  ( brew for apple systems, yum for redhat, apt for ubuntu systems, choco for windows) 
service mgt ;  systemctl, start/stop/enable/status; , archive/data backup, tunlp;checks available ports/addresses and addresses that are in use, systemctl arguments serviceName; eg  systemctl start/stop/status httpd, uptime: Tells how long the system has been running
system mgt ;  change hostname,change date, ping server to check if server is runing
monitoring = monitor system responses and send alerts using the threshold everyminute if cpu/mem usage exceed 80%
4)scheduling and automating task using cron tables
a) backup all data bases every midnight
C) optimize our appservers every month on the 20th  day at midnight (yum update -y & $ yum upgrade -y)


FOR effective RESOURCE UTILIZATION, we utilize soft links bc it uses minimal resources of our system ...  (small l, hard link:-)
