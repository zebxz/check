we use maven for build and tomcat for deployment having integrated it with nginx webserver for loadbalancing & routing traffic from endusers to the appservers 
we bring in sonar for security, then nexus aas a repository for backing up our artifacts and jenkins to automate the end to end process (CI/CD)
Most importantantly or in addition to that; because security is inheerent in our environment we utilize AWS for various levels of security like ........
furtheer more we use docker & kubernetes for .....
and finally Ansible and terrfaorm for ..........


jenkin 7&8
someone is aking we hv nt deployed to tomcat ,, we are going to be deploying containerized app, tomcat was an introduction
  1:12:18 all of these is nt happening in one agent , mvn package will tk place in maven build server, sonar,the code quality analysis will talk to a 3rd party server wich is sonarqube server

2:04:00  we can use jenkins for non java applications and any application as expalined in jenkins shared lib video

***********************************************************************************************************************************************


 

LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat/ngnix tomcat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD, JENKINS automates the end to end process, 
AWS for cloud computing services/resources, DOCKER for containerization ie deploying light weight containers, DOCKER SWAMP for container orchestration, KUBERNETES for
container orchestration/MGT  


DISADVANTAGES OF DOCKER
with docker i cannot v more than 1 replica of webapp for e.g u are deploying ur appl n ders a spike , no i cant v multiple replicas in docker , e.g: so if u decide to run
docker run -name webapp -replicas 5 , ie trying to get the number of replicas u wnat, it wont work.. docker doesnt support it
also, if my engine goes down , my contaiiners will stop running 
also docker doesnt support a scenario wher i can v multiple serveers in a cluster  e.g docker engine1 (with container), docker engine2(with containers) such that if one 
engine is down the 2nd engine can support it ,, docker doesnt v such sys bc the docker ntwrk dose nt support MULTI HOSTING where we can v a cluster of servers, docker 
netwrking sys doesnt support multi hosting and thats a big problem ,, the docker system doesnt v an overlay ntwrk wher u can v a cluster of server, no overlsy ntwrk support
and d worst is that when appl ar deplloyed, to expose them to endusers is very limited and we wil see hw it is diff with kub... bc in docker we do port forwarding bt we wil
see what kub brings to the table

we can use software like docker to deploy applications , to deploy n mange containers bt is it recommanded, shud we use docker ??? we shud nt and u are going to see that shortly, we shud rather
use container managers or ochestration tools like docker swarm kub n open sheet.
when we studied dodcker, we deployed appl using docker bt what are the limitations using docker to deploy applications .,.. we ar going to look at that shortly 7: 43 
bt these ar the contarization software



   SUMMARIZED FOR INTERVIEW
FOR autHORIZATION;
authorisation via RBAC: Roll base access control, 
this is under kub security , u hv to be authenticated n authorized to perform that task
once u are authentictaed n authorized , the task is being executed bt if u werent succesfully authorized, u wil get permission denied/ authentication failed

After sucessful auth/author, 
in docker we deploy our containers directly in containers, in kub they are deployed in what is called ports
so port is the smallest unit in kub
so u wnat to deploy an appli, dis is what happens, the API server receives this information either frm UI or kubctl, n immediately it receives it, it will persist the data 
in our key value store ie etcd,,,
now u wnat to deploy your appl which are deployed in pods .... in your cluster, der is a pry node agent, so in the node it has kubetes, kubetes is the pry node agent ,
therfore, the control plane is communicating with the worker node via this pry node agent , once it commun wit the worker node , it wil be checking for resouce availability
u wnat to deploy a pod , this is a scheduler, this pods requires abt 800mb bt when it comes to availabilty: my node1 got abt 700mb of memory, node9 got abt 8000mb of memory
we v d scheduler, hes going to schedule d pods based on resource availabilty and other factors.. all other factors ar constant .at this time the scheduler will do automatic
scheduling on node9 which has enough enough resource availability.now when the pod, lemme cal it webpod is scheduled on node9, inside the webpod containers nid to be created
now the container runtime wil create n start the container, so now i v my webcontainer inside the pod.
this is the kub architecture, very powerful 
now i v my appl scheduled on the pod, and we nid to deploy multiple replicas , in this case we v 2replicas, the scheduler has scheduled the 2replicas on the 2diff nodes.
therfore 2replicas of the pod have been deployed
inside this cluster we wnat to ensure that we can access this pod, for the pod to be made accessible we ar going to make what is called a service in kuber.
35:34
so u v a service , this service act as a LB
E.G I V A webSVC, what wil happen is that if u wnat to access this appl running in this pod in kub, it is going to be made discoverable using the service
so if u wnat to access the appl, it wil be routed via the service, we call this service discovery, u wnt to discover ur appl, the service is involve
now this entire netwroking wher appls can accessed with relative ease is been suported by a ntwrk agent kube-proxy.

###########if u can xplain dis kub architecture, u ar as good as done 37:26









KUBERNETES
IT is an ochestration engine, an open source platform for managing containerized applications... kubernetes is responsible for container deployment, scaling, descaling of
containers and lB.
actually, kubernetes is nt a replacement for docker bt can be considered as a replacement for docker swamp , kuber is basically more complex than swarm and REQ more work to 
deploy.. born in google written in go and go lang
when we talk abt kub, we classify an all imp tool bc of its imp  of to me as a devops engr, its so important that one of the jobs i can do is a kubernetes administrator 


                           TYPES OF OCHESTRATION TOOLS
Container Orchestration Tools --> :
   Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, OpenShift

TK NOTE OF THIS TREE
kubernetes:    kub has a cluster , 
   cluster: it is a grp of nodes
   nodes:  in the nodes ther are pods 
   pods:  in the pods ther ar containers ..  
   containers :  

therfore in kub we can say that nodes are the subset of the cluster , pods are subset of the nodes and containers are the subset of the pods
cluster ---> nodes ---> pods  ---> containers  :

 cONTROLLER MANAGER.. >>>>>>>>>
E.G IF U deploy ur appl and you want 3pods to be deployed , lets assume 2pods shud be running, if 1pod is down, the controller manger has been instructed to create 2pods, if
one pod goes down, it will automatically create the pod, those are the function of controller mangers



fEATURES:
1)the first feature it has is that it supports what is called automatic scheduling ie it provides advance scheduler to launch contianers on node
2) it has self hidden capabilities, rescheduling, replacinging and rescheduling containers which are dead and the bauty abt it is that if u deploy a wrong application u can 
go back to what was running before so it has automATED ROLBACKS AND rollouts 
so kuben supports rollouts and rollbacks for the desired state of containerized application therfore, if u had a version running and u v a deploy a new version n ders a 
problem, u can rollback 
3) it has horizomtal scaling and LB , kub can be scaled up and down d appl as per REQuirment
4) service discovery & LB
5)WITH kuber DERS no nid to worry about netwrkn n communicatn bc kub wil automatically assign ip address to containers n a single dns name for a set of containers that can LB
TRAFFIC inside the cluser .... 5:00
containers get their ips so u can put a set of containers behind a single L Balancer ... this is a very key aspect service discovery n LB , hw powerful is that 
6)it also supports storage ochestration, u can mount the storage system of your choice , u can either opt for local storage or choose a public cloud 


          KUBERNETES CLUSTER & ITS COMPONENT

kubernetes architecture:  why are we doing kub and why is kub imp in my devops journey , that in all thy knowings u must knw kub
                                ############  kubernetes comes with a cluster in the cluster we v :
controller noder or controlPlane/MasterNodes: this has some components to tk note of:
  apiServer             : this is the main entry point into the cluster, it performs admin task in the cluster
  etcd                  : the key value store ,,, this is like a database
  scheduler  : 
  controllerManagers   : 
workerNodes           :  this is wher appl are running and here we can v node1, to node9  . the components of the nodes includes:
  kubelet             : this is the main agent that runs on the worker node. its the pry node agent
  pod                 : is the smallest unit in kub, in kub contaners are deployed in what is called pods
  container runtime   : and d container runtime we ar going to be seeing is = [Container-d] 
 kube-proxy           : the netwrk agent
21:30
############### in kub if u wnt to perform any task e.g u want to deploy an appl , for that deployment to happen ther are a few things that kub uses, we call it d client
kub client (how u can access ur cluster)  for e.g we hv docker client , the docker cli
22:11
kubernetes-client      : we also hv kub cli , command line interface ,, command line interface here is kubectl
  kubectl              : if u are authorized, u can run 
     kubectl create/delete/get/describe/apply/run/expose 
  so we v the cli which we can use to make some api calls and we also v other APIs 
  ui- DASHBOARD  
  api  ,, others APIs
Or it has a UI wich is called  a dashboard ,, since we started this programe wher v we see any dashboard , to deploy in jenkins we were able to go to the browser,  der was 
a nice dashboard wher we cud create and run jobs
Now in kub, to perform any task in ur cluster,  for docker we cud do stuff like docker build, docer run n our docker client was docker bc all the commands started wit docker
our kub cli is kubectl ... this is our kub server, u want to run a job in kub , u run commands like kubectl run to deploy an appl, what happens is that kubctl is like a msg
that is sent into ur cluster , dis msg comes to ur cluster, u wnt to deploy an appli, so it cud either b frm ur dashboard, or  ur cli. then regrdless of wher the msg is 
coming from, d API server receives the msg on behalf of our cluster,d API sevrer performs admin task n when u execute dis command, this will get you tru authenticaton,so  u
nid to be authenticated n authorization,, 2things wil happen now u v executed kubctl run, wich means u wnt to deploy an appl, for dis to happen, kub nids to authenticate n
authorize u and the authentication and authorization process wil tk place using a file called .kubeconfig file . this is the file dat authenticates you

kubeconfig [.kube/config ] file will authenticate the admin    ....(ur tryn to mk an APi call, tryn to dd smt to b done) so u must be authenticated) 39:34

 AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

FOR autHORIZATION;
authorisation via RBAC: Roll base access control, 
this is under kub security , u hv to be authenticated n authorized to perform that task
once u are authentictaed n authorized , the task is being executed bt if u werent succesfully authorized, u wil get permission denied/ authentication failed

WHO CAN DO WHAT, who can perform what task .. ,, THIS WILL BE SUPPOERTED BY KUB SECURITY  .. 40: 26

  Developers [ Paul, Joyce, Chidi ] 
  Engineers  [ James, Dominion, Janet ]    .... we can assign them diff functions
