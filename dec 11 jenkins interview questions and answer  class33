We use maven to build and manage applications for java codes  in our environment :

Devops process
developers write code >>>> testing>>>  build>>>> deployed >>>> monitored
WHAT IS EXPECTED FORM DEVELOPERS  ???   (When they have a project)
project main composition:
we have established that when developers are writing code 3things are involved
1)source
2) unit - test- cases
3) build scripts 




WHAT IS YOUR TASK AS A DEVOPS ENGR
as a deveops engr, our expectation is to develop, test and build, qualify the applictaion, back them up , deploy and monitor appliction
ignore***Applications are the output from softwares development
therfore, we need a Build tool used to create deployable packages eg tomcat application
In our env, we use maven; maven is an open source java based build tool, 
***ignore*** It was originally developed in java for java codes; The vendor of maven is apache
Maven is a software project management and comprehensive tool OR 
we can use maven to mg8 our project, build, reporting and documentation


WHAT KIND OF PROJECT ARE YOU SUPPORTING IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT?
anS: we suppport java based projects or projects written in java programming language, however; we also support a few.NET, pythn and nodejs projects
we support apps written in java, nodejs by developers java, .NET, nodejs is a programming language

BUILD MEANS 
Build in SDLC Implies:  Software development life cycle
  creating deployable packages from raw codes. for this to happen, it goes through a compiling process
We need a compiler to compile java codes; java software is required for compiling java codes
therefore, java is a prerequisite for maven to run
Also git is required as well;
we are trying to create our maven server bc we are using maven for test and build 
so when developers push the code, we need maven ie our build server to clone the code 
therfore the git plugging has to be installed for us to be able to run git commands 
our  Maven home directory:  /opt/maven  bc; The MHD is where the maven software is extracted  ie where we downloaded & unzipped the maven file
the directory is represented by = M2 _HOME
MHD = /opt/maven [ M2_HOME ]:





opt dir needs root access thats why for us to download we need sudo







***1.01.00
why do w need git
we are trying to create our maven server bc we are using maven for test and build 
so when developers push the codce, we need maven ie our build server to clone the code 
therfore the git plugging has to be installed for us to be able to run git commands 
so we are installing all of the prerequisite software java
java must be installed for maven to run
java is the compiler
