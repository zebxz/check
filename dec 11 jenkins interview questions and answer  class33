***** from sonarqube2*********8 
developers write and comit codes to github, we will use jenkins for automation, with jenkins you are sure to automate these processes. once this is committed to github, a
new commit/version of the application for eg, jenkins will pull, so we are goin to configure an automation for between jenkins and github that automation can be configured
using pull SCM or github webhook.
once jnekins clone the version, it will communicate with another tool called maven and the use of maven is to create packages before the packages are deployed jenkins is 
comunicating with sonarqube/ sonarcloud for code quality to check if the software written by developers is good enough for deployment .
if code quality analysis results to a pass, it means the application can be deployed to an app server which can be running on tomcat or JBOSS ie our client environment.

************* before we deploy we make sure it is backedup in artifacts 


we need to create a backup for our artifacts so that if in the process of deploying tesla there happens to be a failure our backup system is called nexus or Jfrog and our 
artifacts will be bcakedup here, so we are going to have repositories and and inside the repo eg, we will have teslar.war
there should be a monitoring system to monitor our system. 
therfore, jenkins will connect with a notifier so we are configuring a notification called newRelic . if there is a problem an alert will be triggerred that will send out 
email notification so members of the team will be notified that something is going wrong 
jenins acts as a distributor.



****meee*********
we use maven for build and tomcat for deployment having integrated it with nginx webserver for loadbalancing & routing traffic from endusers to the appservers 
we bring in sonar for security, then nexus aas a repository for backing up our artifacts and jenkins for .....
Most importantantly or in addition to that; because security is inheerent in our environment we utilize AWS for various levels of security like ........
furtheer more we use docker & kubernetes for .....
and finally Ansible and terrfaorm for ..........




LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat/ngnix tomcat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD
