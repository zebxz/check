LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR TEST & BUILD creates the packages & artifacts, TOMCAT for deployment, 





APACHE TOMCAT
Tomcat or Apache Tomcat is a light weight, open source web container used to deploy & run java-based web application.
it is developed by Apache software foundation (ASF)
we are managing java based projects - projects that are developed in the java lanaguage

when we do a build, the code will be packaged compiled and artifacts will be created, these packages can be jar/war/ear
before that can happen we are going to pull the code with the command gitpull/clone and once the build is done w ecan deploy the application to the application sever 

  WHAT IS AN APPLICATION SERVER?
An application server is a container upon which you can build and expose business logic and processes to client applications through various protocols including HTTP in 
a n-tier architect
                       Examples of servers
Apache Tomcat - Apache, Jboss/wildfly - Redhat, WEblogic - Oracle, websphere Application Server - IBM, Websphere liberty profile - IBM, Galssfish
                        HOW SHOULD WE EXPOSE APPLICATION TO USERS
The way we expose these applications to users is important


                       MULTI TIER APPL
 Our Appserver is Tomcat, we do not deploy to one appserver, we are deploying (the application) to multiple appservers all of the servers have tomcat installed & this process is automated with the help of a tool called ansible. 
Also, The way we expose these applications to users is important
now to expose this application to users who need to access this application. traffic from the the users is routed to the appserver but for us to manage how traffic is distributed to the appserver we will introduce a security tool which 
is a webserver, our web server will ensure that the appserver doesnt get traffic directly.
it can be an apache webserver ie httpd is installed . the webserver does load balancing. once it receives traffic from endusers, it will listen to the request and 
authenticate the user if its the right user. 
the webserver distributes the traffic evenly by balancing the traffic load it distributes to the appserver
