LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat/ngnix tomcat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD



SDLC, WHAT DO WE CONSIDER WHEN IT COMES TO A QUQLITY SOFTWARE, NEXUS, DISASTER MGT/DISASTER RECOVERY,  MAVEN / NEXUS INTEGRATION,  NEXUS INSTALLATION, 
Who decides on codeQuality:,   Whatâ€™s the difference between code coverage and code quality.  


******  snapshot repositories and releases repositories, the repositories is where i will upload my artifacts into 


START
 In our environment we use nexus to create backups for artifacts in artifactories ie repository where we store/upload artifacts.we are backing up the war files
 *****ignore****  also if we have  NodeJS project we are managing  (NodeJs Repository  [npm, node packages ]  
Nexus acts as a Disaster recovery server for maven    
that way, In a situation where the MAVEN server goes down in the deployment, we just discontinue the process and pull from our artifactories that's how we 
manage the end to end process

Nexus: Is an Open source Artifactory Repository, It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts, We can retrieve artifacts when needed


Nexus Home directory:
  /opt/nexus                                 *****it is where the nexus software is extracted


ls /opt/nexus/etc 
vim/opt/nexus/etc/nexus -default -properties
to change nexus-content-path=/  to   /landmarktech
then 


*********** we create maven-remote-repo in nexus , where we will upload our artifacts

we create snapshots and releases Repo in Nexus
when a job is being done, artifacts from the dev branch area

1:42  stored in the sbapshots Repo  while artifacts from the master branch are uploaded in the releases repo

in our environment we talk about the master branch but some company deploy from release branch, we deploy directly from the master branch 


   MAVEN  NEXUS INTEGRATION
maven, nexus integration: 
  1. Create artifactories[maven-remote-repos] and add them in the  
     distributionMGT tag in pom.xml 
   Therefore in maven we vi pom.xml and replace the snapshot and relaese url with my own 
  ie the link of my snapshot and release repo created in nexus

  2. Configure nexus login credentials in settings.xml file in the conf directory in the maven server and add our nexus credential : 
   we add another copy of bc maven needs to be authenticated to be able to upload to nexus 
         servername>nexus
           userName = admin 
           password= admin@123

 
**************in our environment we are heavy on security most of the time we change default port 
we change default configuration, we want to have our custom setting


2:14:00 to allow redeployment, we change the hosted setting in the repo in nexus ie we open the repository and in hosted we allow redeploy
 OR
we vi pom.xml and change 0.02 to 0.03

1:23:10
to upload into releases we vi pom.xml and remove the - SNAPSHOT  but when we want to upload 

   WHY CAN WE ENABLE DISABLE REDEPLOY 
Most times if we are going to deploy from there, we need to create a new version of the application bc we are ready for deployment. therefore not allowing to
redeploy means that if already have version1 running then you need to create version2 so to send version2 to nexus we vi pom.xml change 001 to 002 nc now we 
are set for deployment but if there is a problem, we can rollback to version1, when you allow redeploy you only update the same version and cant rollback if 
thers a problem
   ****meeeee*** probably bc if it redeploys automatically, it doesnt change in pom.xml and ie it remains as 001, and bc of that when thers a problem you 
cant roll back



2:44   what is 400 error and 500 error  , 400 error, there was an error with my ip address, i didnt add  /engrcecilia for nexus server
2:47 Developers write the pom.xml file, they include the dependencies, pluggin and everything needed, but once the developers have commited the pom.xml file, the source code
and test cases . it is now the work of the devops engrs to take it from ther and start deploying and while deploying building pipelines, integrating maven
with jenkins, sonaqube , nexus by just vi into the pom file and modify the required area.


2:35:00
we can place our nexus server in a diff AZ from where our maven server is running so that if theres a disaster all our servers dnt go down
