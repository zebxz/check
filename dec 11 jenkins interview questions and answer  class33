In our environment,we use git for versioning
Git is a Distributed Version Control systems. DVCS


git comes with source code managers
in each loCAL environment(ie each developers env) gitbash is installed so it captures everything that is done with relative ease
so before we even submit the codes from our local env to scm, GIT  is already installed
 *** meeeee.... gitbash can be installed directly on our windows computer or remotely on linux using mobaxterm    ... my understanding from git2; 14;35
 MobaXterm is a versatile and powerful tool for interacting with Linux systems from a Windows machine, its a windows app designed for remote computing.
