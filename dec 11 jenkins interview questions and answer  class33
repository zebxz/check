why do w need git
we are trying to create our maven server bc we are using maven for test and build 
so when developers push the codce, we need maven ie our build server to clone the code 
therfore the git plugging has to be installed for us to be able to run git commands 
so we are installing all of the prerequisite software java
java must be installed for maven to run
