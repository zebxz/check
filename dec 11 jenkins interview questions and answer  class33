LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat/ngnix tomcat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD



SDLC, WHAT DO WE CONSIDER WHEN IT COMES TO A QUQLITY SOFTWARE, NEXUS, DISASTER MGT/DISASTER RECOVERY,  MAVEN / NEXUS INTEGRATION,  NEXUS INSTALLATION, 
Who decides on codeQuality:,   Whatâ€™s the difference between code coverage and code quality.  


******  snapshot repositories and releases repositories, the repositories is where i will upload my artifacts into 


START
 In our environment we use nexus to create backups for artifacts in artifactories ie repository where we store/upload artifacts.we are backing up the war files
 *****ignore****  also if we have  NodeJS project we are managing  (NodeJs Repository  [npm, node packages ]  
Nexus acts as a Disaster recovery server for maven    
that way, In a situation where the MAVEN server goes down in the deployment, we just discontinue the process and pull from our artifactories that's how we 
manage the end to end process

Nexus: Is an Open source Artifactory Repository, It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts, We can retrieve artifacts when needed


Nexus Home directory:
  /opt/nexus                                 *****it is where the nexus software is extracted


ls /opt/nexus/etc 
vim/opt/nexus/etc/nexus -default -properties
to change nexus-content-path=/  to   /landmarktech
then 


*********** we create maven-remote-repo in nexus , where we will upload our artifacts

we create snapshots and releases Repo in Nexus
when a job is being done, artifacts from the dev branch area

1:42  stored in the sbapshots Repo  while artifacts from the master branch are uploaded in the releases repo

in our environment we talk about the master branch but some company deploy from release branch, we deploy directly from the master branch 


   MAVEN  NEXUS INTEGRATION
maven, nexus integration: 
  1. Create artifactories[maven-remote-repos] and add them in the  
     distributionMGT tag in pom.xml 

  2. Configure nexus login credentials in settings.xml file in the  
     conf directory in the maven server  
           userName = admin 
           password= admin@123
