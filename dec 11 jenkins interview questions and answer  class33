WE BACVKUP IN NEXUS B4 ANY DEPLOYMENT WHICH MAKES NEXUS A VERY IMP TOOL IN OUR SDLC

11.00 maven is doing a build using respository concept 


****meee*********
we use maven for build and tomcat for deployment having integrated it with nginx webserver for loadbalancing & routing traffic from endusers to the appservers 
we bring in sonar for security, then nexus aas a repository for backing up our artifacts and jenkins for .....
Most importantantly or in addition to that; because security is inheerent in our environment we utilize AWS for various levels of security like ........
furtheer more we use docker & kubernetes for .....
and finally Ansible and terrfaorm for ..........




LINUX , scripting, git , maven, tomat/ngnix tomcat, sonar, nexus, jenkins , aws, docker, k8, terraform, ansible, k8/helm 
In our env, we use LINUX OS for file,process,package,security mgt, GIT FOR VERSIONING, MAVEN FOR BUILD, jenkins automates the end to end process, 


                                        WHAT IS JENKINS AUTOMATION  ??
 
What is Jenkins automating ?
  
How do you use Jenkins for CI/CD automation ?
In Landmark, we manage federated JAVA based web & enterprise applications
(web.ear) for Fintech Clients/ DOD/ E-commerce.
We also manage a few python, NodeJs and .net web applications

2. account creation 
3. credit management

********************  INTERVIEW****************
***** from sonarqube2*********8 
developers write and comit codes to github, we will use jenkins for automation, with jenkins you are sure to automate these processes. once this is committed to github, a
new commit/version of the application for eg, jenkins will pull, so we are goin to configure an automation for between jenkins and github that automation can be configured
using pull SCM or github webhook.
once jnekins clone the version, it will communicate with another tool called maven and the use of maven is to create packages before the packages are deployed jenkins is 
comunicating with sonarqube/ sonarcloud for code quality to check if the software written by developers is good enough for deployment .
if code quality analysis results to a pass, it means the application can be deployed to an app server which can be running on tomcat or JBOSS ie our client environment.

in our env,before we deploy we make sure it is backedup in artifacts 
we need to create a backup for our artifacts so that if in the process of deploying,In a situation where the MAVEN server goes down in the deployment, we just discontinue the process and pull from our artifactories 
and our backup system is called nexus or Jfrog and our artifacts will be bcakedup there, 
for our deployment;
we do not recommend to deploy to one appserver/tomcat bc if the app goes down it will be a problem, therefore in our deployment we use ansible or universal code UCD deploY, to deploy to multiple servers for high availability
for high availabilty we have multiple app servers eg app server 1, app server 2, app server3 with the help of another automation tool called ansible
ALso,there should be a monitoring system to monitor our system. 
therfore, jenkins will connect with a notifier so we are configuring a notification called newRelic . if there is a problem an alert will be triggerred that will send out 
email notification so members of the team will be notified that something is going wrong 
 this is the pipeline process
jenkins can help to automates the end to end process
