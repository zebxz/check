we use maven for build and tomcat for deployment having integrated it with nginx webserver for loadbalancing & routing traffic from endusers to the appservers 
we bring in sonar for security, then nexus aas a repository for backing up our artifacts and jenkins to automate the end to end process (CI/CD)
Most importantantly or in addition to that; because security is inheerent in our environment we utilize AWS for various levels of security like ........
furtheer more we use docker & kubernetes for .....
and finally Ansible and terrfaorm for ..........


jenkin 7&8
someone is aking we hv nt deployed to tomcat ,, we are going to be deploying containerized app, tomcat was an introduction
  1:12:18 all of these is nt happening in one agent , mvn package will tk place in maven build server, sonar,the code quality analysis will talk to a 3rd party server wich is sonarqube server

2:04:00  we can use jenkins for non java applications and any application as expalined in jenkins shared lib video

cloud computing, Cloud Service Models/ CSP; CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS, ADVANTAGES OF USING THE CLOUD 1:55:00 REQUIREMENTS OF owning a data center



cloud computing is very imp bc COMPANIES ar migrating very quick &fast from on-prem to cloud we'l be looking at hw aws helps us to manage our infrastructure

with CSP (Cloud Service Providers) like aws, GCP and azure we can pay only for used computing Services

userData - This is a script that can run while creating/launching the server  


, we'l be looking at hw aws helps us to manage our infrastructure
-- 1:28:30 .for our application to be accesed by cx,it nids to be hosted on some computer systems& for that to happen we nid an hardware,on the hardware the OS is instaled
we nid a piece of storage for our database & our appl is running, so we nid to create a data center
Datacenter:
   1. Applications [80%]   = 500MB    #### what is very imp to us is the appl, 1:34:05 our appl can only be held if we hv a piece of storage wich is adequate
   2. Database-storage     = 25000MB = 25GB   
   3. OS  -                = 5000MB  = 10GB .. 1:35:329 ubuntu is 4.6GB 
   4. HardWare
    a computer system comes wit a hardware system, an OS, a storage,IF the OS requires 500mb, we nid a disk space that has up to the volume of 500mb

###### hw do we deploy in tomcat, we copy to webapps .. the tomcat server nids to hv sufficient storage for us deploy the appl successfully
   tomcat = cp target/app.war  /opt/tomcat9/webapps/


Amaka Nwosu  wants to b supplying some financial solutions to cx around the world, for her to start dis coy traditioanlly,she has to buy a coy wit the ryt OS&
storage b4 she can start running her application... this is a challenge so we hv cloud solutions
         AmakaTech
           ---->  WE hv cloud solutions, wit cloud services like aws, we can pay only for what we use

with CSP (Cloud Service Providers) like aws, GCP and azure we can pay only for used computing Services.
Cloud Service Providers    - CSP =e.g  AWS / GCP / AZURE / alibaba/ etc.    
the main cloud service providers :AWS - Amazon Web Services , GCP - Google Cloud platform), AZURE Cloud
 Cloud Service Providers - CSP = AWS / GCP / AZURE 
they Provide computing services / resources like servers, network, storage, security, etc. over the internet from their Datacenters   
   pa

with CSP, we can reduce cost by:
  pay-as-you-go 
  pay-as-you-grow  
  pay-as-you-use

on-prem Datacenter:
     data centers, Own and manage by the user/client  .. #if Amaka acquires everytin hersef, that becomes an on-prem infrastructure bt we can hv some of this services provided to us by
    a cloud provider. 1:40 :48


REQUIREMENTS OF owning a data center:
Dedicated  space
ultra fast internet speed (in todays term)
High  bandwidth superfast INTERNET


 understanding cloud computing is very imp bc COMPANIES ar migrating very quick &fast from on-prem to cloud 
Cloud Service Models:
=====================
IaaS -- Infrastructure as a service  :   has components that is managed by the vendors & managed by us 
e.g ec2 instance  - ec2 
  - SonarQube

PaaS--  Platform  as a service  : aws container registry, aws kubernetes solution
  ECR / EKS / ECS /

The AWS Cloud spans 102 Availability Zones within 32 geographic regions around the world, 
with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and 4 more AWS Regions in Canada,
Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand

what is a region? .... Region  are Logical names  =   
Availability ZONES - AZs   = Physical locations comprising of 
                            one or more ISOLATED Datacenters  

 Regions: us-east-1  = N-Virginia, us-east-2  = Ohio, us-west-1  = N. California , us-west-2  is  Oregon 


Regions: us-east-1  = N-Virginia, us-east-2  = Ohio, us-west-1  = N. California,   us-west-2  is  Oregon 

Regions covers: USA, Canada, Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, Middle East, Australia, 

Can a Lagos based company serve clients around the world with the help AWS ? yes  

in each regon there are diff azs, the azs are engineered to be independent from each other , e.g us east1a is located independently from us east1b

Regions: us-east-1  = N-Virginia, there are 6 azs in this region
  Availability ZONES :  
    us-east-1a --- Arlington
        jenkins-master            9:20 place my jenkins servers in diff az

    us-east-1b --- Fairfax      us-east-1c --- Loudoun 
      jenkins-slave1               jenkins-slave2


11:00 ADVANTAGES OF PLACING MY SERVERS IN DIFF AZS
1) Availability zones - AZs are engineered to be independent from each other
2) A disaster in one cannot/shouldn't affect another AZ.  
   Floods
   earthquake 
   Network failure  
   wildfire


                EXAMPLES OF AWS SERVICES
 ec2 / efs elastic file sys / eks elastic kubernetics serv / ecs elastic container services / iam, identity & access mgt / route53 / elb  


            WHAT TO CONSIDER BEFORE CREATING/HOSTING RESOURCES IN AWS & BEFORE CHOOSING A REGION IN AWS

Regions covers: USA, Canada, Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, Middle East,   
                Australia, 

Can a Lagos based company serve clients around the world with the help AWS ? yes  
for this to happen, This company will need server resources/services [ec2] from AWS
This company will need AWS container resources/services [eks, ecs, ecr, ] 
NB: Not all aws services are found in all aws regions.


1)Availability: elastic cloud compute [ec2]   Not all aws services are found in all aws regions, so we hv to mk sure its avail in the region b4 we launch it
              elastic kubernetes service = EKS 

2) High Availability:  having multiple servers for your applicaction to avoid application outage
  DEPLOY AN Application server  
   1 application Server  : architecture1  .... you can be a cloud architect, can advice the coy that we cannot hv one app server, so lets hv more than 1 app servers
   4 application Servers : architecture2

hIGH availability can be ACHIEVED BY:
      1. Multiple instances of the servers -- 4 = us-east-1a  
      2. Deploy using Multi AZs = us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, us-east-1f  
      3. Deploy using Multi Regions  = us-east-1, VIRGINIA, us-east-2, OHIO, af-west-1,   
      4. Multi-cloud -- AWS/GCP/AZURE

 Cloud Service Providers = 

3) Latency: -- TIME taken TO ACCESS A SERVER/application 
   us-east-2 = Ohio     --- 200ms to access    1
   us-west-2 = Oregon   --- 100ms to access    2   .. THE best
   af-west-1 = CapeTown  -- 500ms to access    3  

4) cost:                          latency              base on cost  
   us-east-2 = Ohio     --- 200ms to access    1    $4/hr  THE BEST
   us-west-2 = Oregon   --- 100ms to access    2    $8/hr 
   af-west-1 = CapeTown  -- 500ms to access    3    $6/hr 

5) customer Location: IF MY cx AR IN LOndon i will place resources to where the cx are
   Ohio           = us-east-2 = Ohio  
   London         = eu-west-2 = London 

6)Complaince / Regulations []: this cud restrict a coy,, e.g in china , chinese based coys ar adv to only choose datacenters within AS/china,, so u cant choose a dif location
when the govt regulations doesnt permit it

7)Security:
  Mosco /  
     

EC2-Basics
==========
  Basic Computer vs      aws-EC2 :
  OS     ----            AMI (OS + Additional Softwares) 
  Hard Drive             EBS (Elastic Block Store)\
  RAM                    RAM
  CPUs[1, 2, 16 core]    Instance type[t2.mirco, t2.medium]
  Network CARD           IP Addressing 
  Firewall               Security Groups

AMI = amazon machine image 

######                                              EC2 INSTANCE PUURCHASE OPTION, HOW ARE WE CHARGED FOR EC2.
  on-demand instances   = most expensive and very flexible, servers can be created & deleted any time, u pay for services whrn servers ar running
           this is gud for studies bc its d only option that supports for free tier bc u ar always expected to terminate ur instabce               studies 

  Reserved instances    =  ,, #####read note, u reserve inatance & u dnt use it u stil pay 4 it, cx can ask for instances to be reserved
this is gud for deploying to prodution    production 
  
spot instances - Bids =   AWS,, will provide based on avail instances so cx wil place a bid after AWS has placed the offer price
this is gud for testing, like high voltage application

AMI = amazon machine image 

                                       
                                                       HOW ARE WE CHARGED FOR EC2.
53:00 instance type is the power of the instance, the specks

e.g  Laptop1: 24 CORES / i9 / 4TB SSD / RAM 128GB  = $9,000 
  Laptop2: 2 CORES / i3 / 1TB HDD   / 8GB       = $700 

AMI = amazon machine image 
      comprises of the OS and other softwares and settings  
  Linux [redhat / centOS / ubuntu / amazonLinux2 / Debian 11 /etc
          Amazon Linux 2 / ]  
  WINDOWS

58:00####things to consider b4 choosing an AMI, THERE ar 3option to choose from
what is in the:
1)Community AMIs: comprises mostly the OS only  
                Generally free 

2)Marketplace AMIs: comprises of the OS and other Licence Softwares 
   splunk -- Amazon Linux 2 + splunk Softwares    
   openvpn --- Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS + 
               Ubuntu 18 LTS

10GB/S   = 10,000MB/S  

3) my AMI = Golden AMIs  :
         
1:01:42 splunk enterprise is used to monitor our servers

1:07:14 t3.2xlarge up to 5 gitabit per sec for band width i.e the internet speed
   vCPUs          RAM      Bandwidth speed  
  c5.metal  96     x86_64  192G  - - 25 Gigabit/sec  
  t2.micro  1      x86_64  1G    - - Low to Moderate

security group is firewALL in front of the server
james an admin/engineer wil access/launch the server by ssh on port 22, while 
paul nids to acces some web content on the server by using http on port 80
for any of them to access this server on our firewall we hv to open http 80 and ssh22  

storage is called ebs volume, after security groups, we configure stored
the speed for hdd is 10 times slowervthan ssd
1:19:25  for volume type, magnetic is like a floppy disk wich use to be used many yrs ago, we dnt nid it,,, so we go for general purpose ssd .. gp3
then launch the instance


INF ABOUT METADATA:  
Metadata: Data about data/  data about the instance
- id         = i-08b0ba39aca738105, privateIP  = 172.31.27.50, publicIP   = 54.187.238.209, DNS-private= ip-172-31-27-50.us-west-2.compute.internal



When we stop a server the private-IP/DNS address cannot changed at restart 
When we stop a server the public-IP address will changed at restart ,,bc the ip address is released once we stop the server
  use an elasticIP to maintain a static public-IP even after restart 


########Ticket044 = Create a and install a webserver in aws...... webapp can be used to serve some web content
with the help of ec2 intance we are able to create servers and connect to them


userData - This is a script that can run while creating/launching the server  




  in answer someones' question as seen below **********   TRANSFERRING FILES OVER THE INTERNET      
therfore i can transfer files over the internet that is found in a particlar server, when a file is found in my server it is diff for individuals to be ble to access the file 
we hv http & https 
 31.00 after installing webserver were endusers able to acces my text  .. yes ( on the internet, using the ip address we could see "Devops is good )

HTTP = hyper text transfer protocol      i can transfer files over the internet in the webserver in CLI so long as the file is in  ( i bliv my server)    
34:00  i can transfer files over the internet in the webserver in CLI, E.G redirecting contents frm one file to another, or changing or adding to my web content
HTTPS = hyper text transfer protocol Secured   = listens on port 443  


the diff btw the http & the htp secured protocol 

http://35.92.51.2/    
https://mylandmarktech.com/      
              http           https  
Data          insecured      secured  ... secured transmission of data
Transfer      clear text,  data is transfferred in clear text     encrypted  .... WHEN IT GETS to the user its is decrypted
certificate   not required   required    
portNumber    80             443  

password:  admin123,     */cxx5%%$#@!fdytdcxsfdsyfdiuoiodofsdcp  but paswd can be easily hacked ( during transmission)

   

**********************       20.36, very soon we will be doing virtual private cloud (vpc)

lets assume we hv THIS VPC called tesla vpc 
####21:00  in AWS we hv tesla vpc its a larger netwrk with 2 smaller networks (so we call this subnetworks)
sutnet1 is public  (with a webserver1) and subnet2 is private with an (app server1).... both in the same ntwrk,, for both to communicate with each oda they can use the
private ntwrk address
*26.00    ..... we hv another engr chidi in a diff ntwrk, he can access the webserver wit the webser pub ip
also if we hv another webserver2 & appserver in another netwrk, for them to communicate with appser1 & appser2,, they wil use the public ntwrk address



****35.00 we wil see the diff classif of aws RES
we hv resources that ar availa zone specific ..ie their scope is within an availa zone 
we also hv resources that their scope is regional and resources that their scope is global





AWS3

AWS STORAGE SOLUTION (THE DIFF TYPES PROVIDED ebs/efs/S3), LIST BLOCK COMMAND(root file system) Create/attached & mount ebs, creating my AMI(amazon machine image) =GOLDEN AMIS, CREATING A LIFE CYCLE FOR MY INSTANCE,
CREATE A lifE cycle TO CREATE SNAPSHOTS FOR MY JENKINS INSTANCE, EFS; file storage examples / SHARED Storage, LAMBA FUNCTIONS, DISASTER RECOVERY


There are 3 diff storage solutions; 

4.45  storage solutions:
  ebs volume  = Elasticblock store
       Required mounting    
       
  efs  volume =  Elastic file storage
       Required mounting 
       sudo yum install nfs-utils
     
  s3 bucket   = object storage 


EBS
When a server is created, ders a piece of storage attached to it, wich is mounted on the server n its called ebs , block store n the only advantage is that the ebs is elastic, so we hv an elastic block store
 therefore if you are launching webserver2 we need this bolck storage
when we launched this webserver2 for eg, we hv a public ip address for eg , most likely its aredhat9 os, it means that this ebs is going to bbe mounted among others within a root file system., 
7.20; heres a mount point on our server
the block storage is unique, bc the ebs on webserver1 cannot be transferrd to webser2 bc they ar blocked/tied to each of the servers   

11.13,   if need be this ebs1, root file system, now this is 14G, can i decide to create another mount point? mayb i want to create anoda mount point point /app , 
yes i can create a mount mount, i can create anoda block storage here



 Root [/] directory has other sub-directories  
what are some of the sub directories we saw in the root dir when we did linux
bc we are mounting on this root file system
we have; /bin,  /home,  /etc/, /var,  /opt / ... this is a root file system
so we are creating a mount point 
for eg, i hv the ticket below 


Ticket0048:
  Create, attached & mount 5G to the /tesla directory    (assume we hv a project for tesla)
20.40  CAan we decide to have  a seperate dir , lets assume this ticket has 2types
  Create, attached & mount 7G to the /var/lib/jenkins directory   (/var/lib/jenkins is the home dir of jenkins and i can decide to create a mount point for myself)


EFS
efs : file storgae 
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple,
 scalable, elastic file system for general purpose 
 workloads for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
  https://youtu.be/AvgAozsfCrY     ... to get some direct inform from aws talking abt efs

efs  volume = file storage / SHARED Storage.. can be shared by one or more srvers or devices
     Requires mounting & we can use a software like netwrk file system
     sudo yum install nfs-utils 
       sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0027f3e4b8f8187ee.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/ efs


exmaples of file storage 
google drive-has a file storage of 400G = legah@gmail.com  
in the drive , i have files: documents, pictures, videos 
mounted on: phones, tablets, computers  
after it is mounted, so all i nid to do is login to my email then i can access the files.... therefore it can be called a shared storage
we can snap pictures with our phone and acces the pictures on several devices due to shared directory& its possible due to elastic file system

NFS = Network file system(traditionally)  = self managed   
EFS = Elastic File system  = managed by AWS , therfore u hv more time to focus on ur applications
so nowadays managed solutions is what is driving many companies

  LAMBA FUNCTION
but the interview question is what hv you done when it comes to AWS services, thers a service in aws called lamba
Lambda functions:
=================  
  If we have upto  75% volume usage increase vol by 20%   
  
in my envi in one of my projects, i was able to use the lamba function, which was written to expand my project by 20% whenevr usage is 75% 
### 1:54so if  df -h / 100G/75G  ie avail 100 and used 75, increase by 20% --  so we then hv 120G
so we can write a lamba function to achieve this process

DIASTER RECOVERY
we can also  write a lamba function , lamba function has what is called diasaster recover
if u work for landmark and we hv aws account1, & aws account2. in account1 we hv a database servers running ,  for account 2 (diaster recovery account, for our database servers backup)
because diaster can occur , eg if someelse is able to access d email&paswd & log into aws wit root access, thers a possiblity of a disaster bc dats a serious issue bc they wil hv 
access to all my servers bt wit account 1 & account 2, our disaster recovery is accont 2, wit our database serververs running in account 1, we back the databases in accout2
by creating a snapshot lifecycle policy using Lambda
