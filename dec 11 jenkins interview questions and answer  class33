TYPES OF TESTING, CODE QUALITY TOOLS, CODE QUALITY BENCHMARK, COMPARING ACTUAL RESULT AGAINST BENCHMARK, CODE QUALITY, SONARQUBE COMPRISES OF, WHERE IS THE SONARQUBE HOME DIR
 VERSIONS OF SONARQUBE WE CAN INSTALL IN OUR ENVIRONMENT, 




START
57:00 *******  duplication can be avoided by using function


********** java is a prerequisite for sonar

      TYPES OF TESTING 

UNit testing [Junit ) : Used to test individual ,  line , units or components of a code 

functional testing: we test how the code ( Application is functioning)

42:30 

REgression testing : frm v1, v2, v3,  
if we add 500 lines to v3, we use 
Regression testing to check if the entire application is working  well based on the addition to the app

eg
helloworld .java = 500 lines of code
helloword test.java = 500 Junit cases cases  expected 


performance testing : is it performing as desire
