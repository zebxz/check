we use maven for build and tomcat for deployment having integrated it with nginx webserver for loadbalancing & routing traffic from endusers to the appservers 
we bring in sonar for security, then nexus aas a repository for backing up our artifacts and jenkins to automate the end to end process (CI/CD)
Most importantantly or in addition to that; because security is inheerent in our environment we utilize AWS for various levels of security like ........
furtheer more we use docker & kubernetes for .....
and finally Ansible and terrfaorm for ..........


jenkin 7&8
someone is aking we hv nt deployed to tomcat ,, we are going to be deploying containerized app, tomcat was an introduction
  1:12:18 all of these is nt happening in one agent , mvn package will tk place in maven build server, sonar,the code quality analysis will talk to a 3rd party server wich is sonarqube server

2:04:00  we can use jenkins for non java applications and any application as expalined in jenkins shared lib video

cloud computing, Cloud Service Models/PROVIDERS, ADVANTAGES OF USING THE CLOUD 1:55:00
cloud computing is very imp bc COMPANIES ar migrating very quick &fast from on-prem to cloud we'l be looking at hw aws helps us to manage our infrastructure

with CSP (Cloud Service Providers) like aws, GCP and azure we can pay only for used computing Services


, we'l be looking at hw aws helps us to manage our infrastructure
-- 1:28:30 .for our application to be accesed by cx,it nids to be hosted on some computer systems& for that to happen we nid an hardware,on the hardware the OS is instaled
we nid a piece of storage for our database & our appl is running, so we nid to create a data center
Datacenter:
   1. Applications [80%]   = 500MB    #### what is very imp to us is the appl, 1:34:05 our appl can only be held if we hv a piece of storage wich is adequate
   2. Database-storage     = 25000MB = 25GB   
   3. OS  -                = 5000MB  = 10GB .. 1:35:329 ubuntu is 4.6GB 
   4. HardWare
    a computer system comes wit a hardware system, an OS, a storage,IF the OS requires 500mb, we nid a disk space that has up to the volume of 500mb

###### hw do we deploy in tomcat, we copy to webapps .. the tomcat server nids to hv sufficient storage for us deploy the appl successfully
   tomcat = cp target/app.war  /opt/tomcat9/webapps/


Amaka Nwosu  wants to b supplying some financial solutions to cx around the world, for her to start dis coy traditioanlly,she has to buy a coy wit the ryt OS&
storage b4 she can start running her application... this is a challenge so we hv cloud solutions
         AmakaTech
           ---->  WE hv cloud solutions, wit cloud services like aws, we can pay only for what we use

with CSP (Cloud Service Providers) like aws, GCP and azure we can pay only for used computing Services.
Cloud Service Providers    - CSP =e.g  AWS / GCP / AZURE / alibaba/ etc.    
the main cloud service providers :AWS - Amazon Web Services , GCP - Google Cloud platform), AZURE Cloud
   pa

with CSP, we can reduce cost by:
  pay-as-you-go 
  pay-as-you-grow  
  pay-as-you-use

on-prem Datacenter:
     data centers, Own and manage by the user/client  .. #if Amaka acquires everytin hersef, that becomes an on-prem infrastructure bt we can hv some of this services provided to us by
    a cloud provider. 1:40 :48


REQUIREMENTS OF owning a data center:
Dedicated  space
ultra fast internet speed (in todays term)
High  bandwidth superfast INTERNET


 understanding cloud computing is very imp bc COMPANIES ar migrating very quick &fast from on-prem to cloud 
Cloud Service Models:
=====================
IaaS -- Infrastructure as a service  :   has components that is managed by the vendors & managed by us 
e.g ec2 instance  - ec2 
  - SonarQube

PaaS--  Platform  as a service  : aws container registry, aws kubernetes solution
  ECR / EKS / ECS /
