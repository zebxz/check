maven1: 2;12:20
why is it called securing the maven local repo??
we created the custom maven repo incase the local repo is deleted, i checked; the package is not backe dup in both repo,based on the configurtaion we did in settings.xml, the package is either backed up in the maven repo OR the custom repo
therefore; if the packages wont be both repositories, how is creating a custom repo meant to secure the local repo ... does it mean that the custom maven repo cannot be deleted??
MAVEN2; WHEN WE RUN "maven install" IT BACKS UP THE Packages in the repo  *** either in the .m2 maven local repo OR the custom maven repo) 
i checked  the custom repo, the package was in it; ls /home/ec2-user/.mlr/com/ 
but it was not in  ls /home/ec2-user/.m2/com/

   INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
IQ: Explain you experience in open source technologies?
      1. Maven 
      2. Linux OS  

WHAT KIND OF PROJECT ARE YOU SUPPORTING IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT?
anS: we suppport java based projects or projects written in java programming language, however; we also support a few.NET, pythn and nodejs projects
we support apps written in java, nodejs by developers java, .NET, nodejs is a programming language


IQ) WHAT are the diffERENT BUILD TOOLS FOR EACH OF THE PROGRAMMING  LANGUAGE

for java projects the build tools
you can build using >>> MAVEN /ANT/CRADDLE

Net: THESE are the tools that will be used to convey the raw code written in .Net to deployable packages
NANt/MSBuild

JAVA SCRIPT:
Gulp/Grunt  

python:
Py Builder

Ruby:
Rake

NodeJs:
npm



IQ) WHAT IS EXPECTED FORM DEVELOPERS  ???   (When they have a project)
project main composition:
we have established that when developers are writing code 3things are involved
1)source
2) unit - test- cases
3) build scripts 


IQ) ****UNIT TESTING
the process of writing and running unit-tests-cases is called : Unit testing

 
IQ) ***TO AUTOMATE TESTING, WE ARE GOIN TO ADVICE DEVELOPERS 
TO integrate selenium in their environment such that these unit test cases can be easily written and run


IQ) ***   WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BTW THE 2 FILES (hello.java & hello.class)
  hello.java ---> Human readable file  
  hello.class --> machine[JVM] readable file  [binary file = 012310123345] 
once you compile a java code like javac hello.java, the result will be - hello.class

JVM only read binary files 
jvm = Java Virtual Machine 


IQ) 2) *** Java is a pre-requisite for maven to run 
    JRE --> JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT
    JDK --> JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT 1.8+
            JVM will also be installed      (once java is installed, this installs automatically)

so when developers push the code, we need maven ie our build server to clone the code 
therfore the git plugging has to be installed for us to be able to run git commands 


IQ: Create Security Group and open Required ports.22 ..etc


IQ: What is MHD ==  
The maven home directory is wher the maven software is extracted == /opt/maven 
and we can ls to see the content of the MHD


IQ:
now we ls to see the content /composition of our maven home dir 

 [ec2-user@maven maven]$ ls
mavenHomeDir = M2_HOME = /opt/maven :
  bin --- binary files and the most impoetant file is mvn        *** 23,maven 1b, (the paths to where the dir are found in )
            
  conf  --configuration files and the most imp fie is settings.xml 
          
  lib -- jar files and libraries 
  boot  


WHAT CAN MAKE MVN COMMAND NOT TO RUN
1:38:39 maven also have to be installed properly for mvn command to run
ie downloaded and extracted properly
you have to determine where your maven home directory is defined with the export command
eg we defined ours in the file ; ~/.bash_profile , ****meeee** **when we copied and pasted the environmental variables
PLEASE COPY AND PASTE IT, ABOVE OR BELOW IN THE FILE, Not inbetween lines of information.
   **** we could also use a different location for eg if we use the .bashrc file.  



IQ: pom.xml        --- BuildScript for maven..... it is written in xml language
in pom.xml it has defined the project properties, dependencies (Junit testing has to be performed
5) cd msa/   .. the the appl we cloned from git hub and renamed

6) ls and we see pom.xml & src cd msa/
head pom.xml : this project file will include stuffs like project dependencies and Artifacts (it will be creating some artifacts)
for this project to be executed a few things are needed,
scm is in github , everything has been defined

7)ls src/ & we can see main & test case file 



DIFF BTW ;mvn package  7 mvn install
 ***** mvn install is creating/generating the package in the the target dir of our project & also uploading the artifacts into the maven local/default repo OR custom repo, depending on the configuration in the settings.xml file.
WHILE 
mvn package will only create/generating the package in the the target dir of our project



IQ

******* dependencies are just what the project depends on eg the project needs to perform unit testing so all what is needed for the unit testing will be defined in the 
dependency 


IQ: where are these dependencies found/located??? :
dependencies and/or are located in maven repositories

IQ:  we can have diff repository
                                                                                                                                                       for the project
<repositories>             **** dependencies and pluggins are found in any of these repo, maven will search for the project dependencies in any of these repo & use the repo
   mavenLocalRepo         (maven server)    ****** .m2/repository = default                             
   mavenRemoteRepo         (nexus server)
   mavenProxyRepo           (nexus server apache maven )
   mavenCentralRepo         the internet    ****** https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central
</repositories>


IQ:
when maven is trying to create packages it will use these pluggin


IQ : Explain the maven lifecycle  ??
Maven has 3 lifecycles: 
  Clean, 
  site/swagger and 
  default
  
IQ: How do you secure the maven local repo 
 sudo vi /opt/maven/conf/settings.xml    **** we vi and create a custom maven repo
***we can aslo : sudo echo "<localRepository>/home/ec2-user/.mlr</localRepository>">> /opt/maven/conf/setting
so we want to echo this information, we are redirecting to this file .. /opt
 if you run it the first time it will work but if you try to change it again it will be a problem 
so vi/ng into the file is the best


2:38:38 
                                                      QUSETION

is it possible to create the maven repo without vi/ing into the file,   ???
    without vi into the /opt/maven/conf/setting.xml   ??

                                                                       (THIS IS JUST ME on why we cd into msa)
                                                                     1:43:33 
                 cd java-projects  ,  now i run tree msa, n we see we hv 12dir &3files, this is the project we are working on,we see d code,include d pom.xml d project file
                                        ( msa is maven stanalone appl)         cd msa/  & when we ls we see (src and pom.xml), now no package hv been created
                                            to create a package we run mvn package, packages created build successful and a new dir target has been created

                                                 2:20:14   ( now this is the file we are modifying;  opt/maven/conf/setting.xml ) , seacrhing for maven local repo        

ANS:
ITS possible to create the maven repo without vi/ing into the file but again you need to vi

but how could we create the maven repo without vi/ing??
                                                                                                          
 now this is the file we are modifying;  opt/maven/conf/setting.xml                                        
we could do something like this, like we can also

we can aslo : sudo echo "<localRepository>/home/ec2-user/.mlr</localRepository>">> /opt/maven/conf/setting
so we want to echo this information, we are redirecting to this file .. /opt
so i want to append this line into this file 
                    **********  you hv to do sudo before you can echo bc not every user can write in this file , the file is owned by the root user
 if you run it the first time it will work but if you try to change it again it will be a problem 
so vi/ng into the file is the best



     HOW DO WE KNOW THE DEPENDENCIES TO DOWNLOAD 

our project ahs a project file called pom.xml and when thers a project, thers a meeting where DEVOPS and developers will agree/decide that for this project there are the 
dependencies  we are going to need, so it makes it a smooth process in terms of how we are going to define our dependencies in pom.xml

eg
if ther are 100 dependencies, they can decide thay are goin to use 10 and define the 10 in pom.xml, therfore the project will be deploying with just the 10 that have been 
choosen to ensure the right dependencies are deployed to production


***** maven 1b , 1:40:00

mvn command will not run if maven is not installed correctly and ensuring our maven home is defined  accordingly 

mvn is a binary file that we use to run packages and it can be found in bin 


                              TO SEE FILES IN BIN

files in bin = ls /opt/maven/bin/



MAVEN2
maven has Quality Gates, checking that test cases passes before  packages created.  :
  IQ:1. Assuming that 699 Testcases passed and 1 fails, 
        what can be done for  maven to still do a build? 
          ****** by default maven wont do a build, it will inform us that somthing is wrong 
          Also we can decide that since 699 testcases passed and i failed we should proceed with the deployment

24:15   but what can be done for maven to still do a build if a (1)test fails
           mvn package -DskipTests OR mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
           This will skip the testing processing

    2. Also Some projects are taking long to build how can we resolve the issue:?
       we skip the test goal   (this may comprise quality)
           by running the test the first time we got to know that 699 passed and i failed, so it is possible for me to skip the test cases
          mvn package -DskipTests
           mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true  


3. What problems have you faced in your project recently? 
=========================================================
  Maven taking longer than expected time to build artifacts.  (this is a serious problem)
 now Maven uses plugins and dependencies to validate,
  compile, RunUnitTests and creates artifacts. 
    so if its taking much time to run the testing, we can skip the testing process

alos These plugins and dependencies are located in either:
    1. MavenLocalRepo  or
    2. maven-remote-repo or
    3. maven-proxy-repo or 
    3. Maven-central repo  


to expedite the process
**** so we can ensure that maven has direct access to maven local repo to be able to get dependencies and pluggins

28:30
pulling plugins and dependencies from mavenLocalRepo give    
  the best/fastest Results regarding time. 
  Maven-local-repo was accidentally deleted by a Jr. Engineer  

if a project is taking longer than expected to execute it could mean that maven is closing from the internet and that takes longer time naturally


IQ:
for maven to know which package to create its a function of our project
when we vi pom.xml we can see the archive file/packing indication? jar OR war OR ear




 a) ******** IQ:
HOW ARE JAVA BASED STANALONE applications deployed??
ANS; 
java -jar app.jar
eg; java -jar target/maven-stanalone-application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar    ***** app.jar, this is just a placeholder it can be any name you choose)

      **** WE ARE going to look at tomcat & JBOSS when we are talkingabout web applications 
b)IQ:
HOW ARE JAVA BASED web applications deployed??

ANS:
Are deployed in Tomcat/JBOSS servers
if you want to deploy a maven web application, we need a maven software installed like tomcat/OR JBOSS


c) IQ:
How are java based enterprise applications deployed??
enterprise application are deployed in JBOSS servers




IQ: 
IN managing federated web and enterprise micro- service applications for fintech clients 

An enterpriseapplication with over 21 modules

how can a specific module be built in maven-enterprise application
for example, developers have done a change in module one 

 by passing the PL flag                ..........  ?????
mvn package -P1 profile name
mvn package - P1 maven enterprise -web
mvn package - P maven Enterprise -web

57:45
if there are many modules but cahnge in only one module 
we build by choosing that particular profile
by using the ? web flag



1:16 
FOR ARTIFACT  to be created maven has to be installed and for us to be able to pull clone the codes from github, in our build server we hv to yum install git 



1:32:17 
the child pom.xml is referring to the parent which means thers can of an intersection, so when you run mvn build all those pom.xml will be ultilized




  1:00 
how can we trouble -shoot a fail build in MAVEN ??
Check the logs to understand the errors
mvn - x package (BUILD in debugging mode) This will build in debugging mode 


1:24 there are some issues i can TS as a devops engineer AND there are some issue i will escalate to the developers that this build is not responding pls correct them 
accordingly or pls modify the project file ie pom.xml


1:24:54

if you are doing a build and you are not doing it in the project file the build will fail or in a diff dir it wont work 
you must be in the project directory 



what is the function of tomcat
