   INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
IQ: Explain you experience in open source technologies?
      1. Maven 
      2. Linux OS  

WHAT KIND OF PROJECT ARE YOU SUPPORTING IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT?
anS: we suppport java based projects or projects written in java programming language, however; we also support a few.NET, pythn and nodejs projects
we support apps written in java, nodejs by developers java, .NET, nodejs is a programming language


IQ) WHAT are the diffERENT BUILD TOOLS FOR EACH OF THE PROGRAMMING  LANGUAGE

for java projects the build tools
you can build using >>> MAVEN /ANT/CRADDLE

Net: THESE are the tools that will be used to convey the raw code written in .Net to deployable packages
NANt/MSBuild

JAVA SCRIPT:
Gulp/Grunt  

python:
Py Builder

Ruby:
Rake

NodeJs:
npm














IQ) WHAT IS EXPECTED FORM DEVELOPERS  ???   (When they have a project)
project main composition:
we have established that when developers are writing code 3things are involved
1)source
2) unit - test- cases
3) build scripts 


IQ) ****UNIT TESTING
the process of writing and running unit-tests-cases is called : Unit testing

 
IQ) ***TO AUTOMATE TESTING, WE ARE GOIN TO ADVICE DEVELOPERS 
TO integrate selenium in their environment such that these unit test cases can be easily written and run


IQ) ***   WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BTW THE 2 FILES (hello.java & hello.class)
  hello.java ---> Human readable file  
  hello.class --> machine[JVM] readable file  [binary file = 012310123345] 
once you compile a java code like javac hello.java, the result will be - hello.class

JVM only read binary files 
jvm = Java Virtual Machine 


IQ) 2) *** Java is a pre-requisite for maven to run 
    JRE --> JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT
    JDK --> JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT 1.8+
            JVM will also be installed      (once java is installed, this installs automatically)

so when developers push the code, we need maven ie our build server to clone the code 
therfore the git plugging has to be installed for us to be able to run git commands 


IQ: Create Security Group and open Required ports.22 ..etc


IQ: What is MHD ==  
The maven home directory is wher the maven software is extracted == /opt/maven 
and we can ls to see the content of the MHD


IQ:
now we ls to see the content /composition of our maven home dir 

 [ec2-user@maven maven]$ ls
mavenHomeDir = M2_HOME = /opt/maven :
  bin --- binary files and the most impoetant file is mvn        *** 23,maven 1b, (the paths to where the dir are found in )
            
  conf  --configuration files and the most imp fie is settings.xml 
          
  lib -- jar files and libraries 
  boot  


WHAT CAN MAKE MVN COMMAND NOT TO RUN
1:38:39 maven also have to be installed properly for mvn command to run
ie downloaded and extracted properly
you have to determine where your maven home directory is defined with the export command
eg we defined ours in the file ; ~/.bash_profile , ****meeee** **when we copied and pasted the environmental variables
PLEASE COPY AND PASTE IT, ABOVE OR BELOW IN THE FILE, Not inbetween lines of information.
   **** we could also use a different location for eg if we use the .bashrc file.  



IQ: pom.xml        --- BuildScript for maven
in pom.xml it has defined the project properties, dependencies (Junit testing has to be performed
5) cd msa/   .. the the appl we cloned from git hub and renamed

6) ls and we see pom.xml & srccd msa/
head pom.xml : this project file will include stuffs like project dependencies and Artifacts (it will be creating some artifacts)
for this project to be executed a few things are needed,
scm is in github , everything has been defined

7)ls src/ & we can see main & test case file 


IQ

******* dependencies are just what the project depends on eg the project needs to perform unit testing so all what is needed for the unit testing will be defined in the 
dependency 


IQ: where are these dependencies found/located??? :
dependencies and/or are located in maven repositories

IQ:  we can have diff repository
                                                                                                                                                       for the project
<repositories>             **** dependencies and pluggins are found in any of these repo, maven will search for the project dependencies in any of these repo & use the repo
   mavenLocalRepo         (maven server)    ****** .m2/repository = default                             
   mavenRemoteRepo         (nexus server)
   mavenProxyRepo           (nexus server apache maven )
   mavenCentralRepo         the internet    ****** https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central
</repositories>


IQ:
when maven is trying to create packages it will use these pluggin


IQ : Explain the maven lifecycle  ??
Maven has 3 lifecycles: 
  Clean, 
  site/swagger and 
  default
  Clean, site and default
