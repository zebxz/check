anS: we suppport java based projects or projects written in java programming language, however; we also support a few.NET, pythn and nodejs projects
we support apps written in java, nodejs by developers java, .NET, nodejs is a programming language


IQ) WHAT are the diffERENT BUILD TOOLS FOR EACH OF THE PROGRAMMING  LANGUAGE

for java projects the build tools
you can build using >>> MAVEN /ANT/CRADDLE

Net: THESE are the tools that will be used to convey the raw code written in .Net to deployable packages

project main composition:
we have established that when developers are writing code 3things are involved
1)source
2) unit - test- cases
3) build scripts 


IQ) ****UNIT TESTING
the process of writing and running unit-tests-cases is called : Unit testing

 
IQ) ***TO AUTOMATE TESTING, WE ARE GOIN TO ADVICE DEVELOPERS 
TO integrate selenium in their environment such that these unit test cases can be easily written and run


IQ) ***   WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BTW THE 2 FILES (hello.java & hello.class)
  hello.java ---> Human readable file  
  hello.class --> machine[JVM] readable file  [binary file = 012310123345] 
once you compile a java code like javac hello.java, the result will be - hello.class

JVM only read binary files 
jvm = Java Virtual Machine 


IQ) 2) *** Java is a pre-requisite for maven to run 
    JRE --> JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT
    JDK --> JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT 1.8+
            JVM will also be installed      (once java is installed, this installs automatically)
