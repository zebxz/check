Mobaxterm is our ssh client

MY PERSONAL QUESTIONS

can we run the scp command in a server that has any software installed in it ?  mee yeee

whats the diff in the way we install tomcat/maven and the way sonar is installed, where we hv to first create a user sonar???


whats the diff btw   "su - landmark" and "sudo su - ec2-user  , we normally cal it to change shell when we are doing software installation ... ?/???
 *** so if am using diff keys for both maven and tomcat, 1) do i need to create a file for the key in both servers and in which of the servers do i run chmod 400
also, 2) if i am using diff keys , do i need to create a file for tomcat key in tomcat server and after i create a file for the tomcat key in maven server do i run chmod for the tomcat key in both servers?


*** what are tthe diff ways to connct to mabxterm?
1) i know of connecting through local terminal ie open a new tab and (ssh -i "yes.pem" ec2-user@ec2-18-223-16-218.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com)
is this the same as connecting using shell?
2) connecting usng remote hostname ie open a new section  and inputing the remote hostname ie ip adress and username and key 
 is ther any other way? 


1) how is troubleshooting done?
Does each software have a diff debugging/ts route or method?

why is it red? 
WHAT IS UNPACKING
/opt/tomcat9/webapps/
when u deploy it copies the war file into the webapps dir and unpack it
unpack means eg when we copied the file we copied maven-web-app but when it goes to 'webapp dir',its extracting, & we see /app & app.war (app.war is red)why?
so when u do deployment u are copying this war file into the webapps dir and when its gets ther its automatically extracted which means its unpacked. 


2) Confirm frm my notes if i created the file thats contains Agile


maven1: 2;12:20
why is it called securing the maven local repo??
we created the custom maven repo incase the local repo is deleted, i checked; the package is not backed up in both repoS, based on the configurtaion we did 
in settings.xml, the package is either backed up in the maven repo OR the custom repo
therefore; if the packages wont be in both repositories, how is creating a custom repo meant to secure the local repo ... does it mean that the custom maven 
repo cannot be deleted??
MAVEN2; WHEN WE RUN "maven install" IT BACKS UP THE Packages in the repo  *** either in the .m2 maven local repo OR the custom maven repo) 
i checked  the custom repo, the package was in it; ls /home/ec2-user/.mlr/com/ 
but it was not in  ls /home/ec2-user/.m2/com/

   INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
IQ: Explain you experience in open source technologies?
      1. Maven 
      2. Linux OS  

WHAT KIND OF PROJECT ARE YOU SUPPORTING IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT?
anS: we suppport java based projects or projects written in java programming language, however; we also support a few.NET, pythn and nodejs projects
we support apps written in java, nodejs by developers java, .NET, nodejs is a programming language


IQ) WHAT are the diffERENT BUILD TOOLS FOR EACH OF THE PROGRAMMING  LANGUAGE

for java projects the build tools
you can build using >>> MAVEN /ANT/CRADDLE

Net: THESE are the tools that will be used to convey the raw code written in .Net to deployable packages
NANt/MSBuild

JAVA SCRIPT:
Gulp/Grunt  

python:
Py Builder

Ruby:
Rake

NodeJs:
npm



IQ) WHAT IS EXPECTED FORM DEVELOPERS  ???   (When they have a project)
project main composition:
we have established that when developers are writing code 3things are involved
1)source
2) unit - test- cases
3) build scripts 


IQ) ****UNIT TESTING
the process of writing and running unit-tests-cases is called : Unit testing

 
IQ) ***TO AUTOMATE TESTING, WE ARE GOIN TO ADVICE DEVELOPERS 
TO integrate selenium in their environment such that these unit test cases can be easily written and run


IQ) ***   WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BTW THE 2 FILES (hello.java & hello.class)
  hello.java ---> Human readable file  
  hello.class --> machine[JVM] readable file  [binary file = 012310123345] 
once you compile a java code like javac hello.java, the result will be - hello.class

JVM only read binary files 
jvm = Java Virtual Machine 


IQ) 2) *** Java is a pre-requisite for maven to run 
    JRE --> JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT
    JDK --> JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT 1.8+
            JVM will also be installed      (once java is installed, this installs automatically)

so when developers push the code, we need maven ie our build server to clone the code 
therfore the git plugging has to be installed for us to be able to run git commands 


IQ: Create Security Group and open Required ports.22 ..etc


IQ: What is MHD ==  
The maven home directory is wher the maven software is extracted == /opt/maven 
and we can ls to see the content of the MHD


IQ:
now we ls to see the content /composition of our maven home dir 

 [ec2-user@maven maven]$ ls
mavenHomeDir = M2_HOME = /opt/maven :
  bin --- binary files and the most impoetant file is mvn        *** 23,maven 1b, (the paths to where the dir are found in )
            
  conf  --configuration files and the most imp fie is settings.xml 
          
  lib -- jar files and libraries 
  boot  


WHAT CAN MAKE MVN COMMAND NOT TO RUN
1:38:39 maven also have to be installed properly for mvn command to run
ie downloaded and extracted properly
you have to determine where your maven home directory is defined with the export command
eg we defined ours in the file ; ~/.bash_profile , ****meeee** **when we copied and pasted the environmental variables
PLEASE COPY AND PASTE IT, ABOVE OR BELOW IN THE FILE, Not inbetween lines of information.
   **** we could also use a different location for eg if we use the .bashrc file.  



IQ: pom.xml        --- BuildScript for maven..... it is written in xml language
in pom.xml it has defined the project properties, dependencies (Junit testing has to be performed
5) cd msa/   .. the the appl we cloned from git hub and renamed

6) ls and we see pom.xml & src cd msa/
head pom.xml : this project file will include stuffs like project dependencies and Artifacts (it will be creating some artifacts)
for this project to be executed a few things are needed,
scm is in github , everything has been defined

7)ls src/ & we can see main & test case file 



DIFF BTW ;mvn package  7 mvn install
 ***** mvn install is creating/generating the package in the the target dir of our project & also uploading the artifacts into the maven local/default repo OR custom repo, depending on the configuration in the settings.xml file.
WHILE 
mvn package will only create/generating the package in the the target dir of our project



IQ

******* dependencies are just what the project depends on eg the project needs to perform unit testing so all what is needed for the unit testing will be defined in the 
dependency 


IQ: where are these dependencies found/located??? :
dependencies and/or are located in maven repositories

IQ:  we can have diff repository
                                                                                                                                                       for the project
<repositories>             **** dependencies and pluggins are found in any of these repo, maven will search for the project dependencies in any of these repo & use the repo
   mavenLocalRepo         (maven server)    ****** .m2/repository = default                             
   mavenRemoteRepo         (nexus server)
   mavenProxyRepo           (nexus server apache maven )
   mavenCentralRepo         the internet    ****** https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central
</repositories>


IQ:
when maven is trying to create packages it will use these pluggin


IQ : Explain the maven lifecycle  ??
Maven has 3 lifecycles: 
  Clean, 
  site/swagger and 
  default
  
IQ: How do you secure the maven local repo 
 sudo vi /opt/maven/conf/settings.xml    **** we vi and create a custom maven repo
***we can aslo : sudo echo "<localRepository>/home/ec2-user/.mlr</localRepository>">> /opt/maven/conf/setting
so we want to echo this information, we are redirecting to this file .. /opt
 if you run it the first time it will work but if you try to change it again it will be a problem 
so vi/ng into the file is the best


2:38:38 
                                                      QUSETION

is it possible to create the maven repo without vi/ing into the file,   ???
    without vi into the /opt/maven/conf/setting.xml   ??

                                                                       (THIS IS JUST ME on why we cd into msa)
                                                                     1:43:33 
                 cd java-projects  ,  now i run tree msa, n we see we hv 12dir &3files, this is the project we are working on,we see d code,include d pom.xml d project file
                                        ( msa is maven stanalone appl)         cd msa/  & when we ls we see (src and pom.xml), now no package hv been created
                                            to create a package we run mvn package, packages created build successful and a new dir target has been created

                                                 2:20:14   ( now this is the file we are modifying;  opt/maven/conf/setting.xml ) , seacrhing for maven local repo        

ANS:
ITS possible to create the maven repo without vi/ing into the file but again you need to vi

but how could we create the maven repo without vi/ing??
                                                                                                          
 now this is the file we are modifying;  opt/maven/conf/setting.xml                                        
we could do something like this, like we can also

we can aslo : sudo echo "<localRepository>/home/ec2-user/.mlr</localRepository>">> /opt/maven/conf/setting
so we want to echo this information, we are redirecting to this file .. /opt
so i want to append this line into this file 
                    **********  you hv to do sudo before you can echo bc not every user can write in this file , the file is owned by the root user
 if you run it the first time it will work but if you try to change it again it will be a problem 
so vi/ng into the file is the best



     HOW DO WE KNOW THE DEPENDENCIES TO DOWNLOAD 

our project ahs a project file called pom.xml and when thers a project, thers a meeting where DEVOPS and developers will agree/decide that for this project there are the 
dependencies  we are going to need, so it makes it a smooth process in terms of how we are going to define our dependencies in pom.xml

eg
if ther are 100 dependencies, they can decide thay are goin to use 10 and define the 10 in pom.xml, therfore the project will be deploying with just the 10 that have been 
choosen to ensure the right dependencies are deployed to production


***** maven 1b , 1:40:00

mvn command will not run if maven is not installed correctly and ensuring our maven home is defined  accordingly 

mvn is a binary file that we use to run packages and it can be found in bin 


                              TO SEE FILES IN BIN

files in bin = ls /opt/maven/bin/



MAVEN2
maven has Quality Gates, checking that test cases passes before  packages created.  :
  IQ:1. Assuming that 699 Testcases passed and 1 fails, 
        what can be done for  maven to still do a build? 
          ****** by default maven wont do a build, it will inform us that somthing is wrong 
          Also we can decide that since 699 testcases passed and i failed we should proceed with the deployment

24:15   but what can be done for maven to still do a build if a (1)test fails
           mvn package -DskipTests OR mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
           This will skip the testing processing

    2. Also Some projects are taking long to build how can we resolve the issue:?
       we skip the test goal   (this may comprise quality)
           by running the test the first time we got to know that 699 passed and i failed, so it is possible for me to skip the test cases
          mvn package -DskipTests
           mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true  


3. What problems have you faced in your project recently? 
=========================================================
  Maven taking longer than expected time to build artifacts.  (this is a serious problem)
 now Maven uses plugins and dependencies to validate,
  compile, RunUnitTests and creates artifacts. 
    so if its taking much time to run the testing, we can skip the testing process

alos These plugins and dependencies are located in either:
    1. MavenLocalRepo  or
    2. maven-remote-repo or
    3. maven-proxy-repo or 
    3. Maven-central repo  


to expedite the process
**** so we can ensure that maven has direct access to maven local repo to be able to get dependencies and pluggins

28:30
pulling plugins and dependencies from mavenLocalRepo give    
  the best/fastest Results regarding time. 
  Maven-local-repo was accidentally deleted by a Jr. Engineer  

if a project is taking longer than expected to execute it could mean that maven is closing from the internet and that takes longer time naturally


IQ:
for maven to know which package to create its a function of our project
when we vi pom.xml we can see the archive file/packing indication? jar OR war OR ear




 a) ******** IQ:
HOW ARE JAVA BASED STANALONE applications deployed??
ANS; 
java -jar app.jar
eg; java -jar target/maven-stanalone-application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar    ***** app.jar, this is just a placeholder it can be any name you choose)

      **** WE ARE going to look at tomcat & JBOSS when we are talkingabout web applications 
b)IQ:
HOW ARE JAVA BASED web applications deployed??

ANS:
Are deployed in Tomcat/JBOSS servers
if you want to deploy a maven web application, we need a maven software installed like tomcat/OR JBOSS


c) IQ:
How are java based enterprise applications deployed??
enterprise application are deployed in JBOSS servers




IQ: 
Am managing federated web and enterprise micro- service applications for fintech clients 
An enterpriseapplication with over 21 modules


how can a specific module be built in maven-enterprise application
for example, developers have done a change in module one 

 by passing the PL flag               
mvn package -P1  for profile name 
eg
mvn package - P1 maven enterprise -web  ***** ie we want build only the maven enterprise-web package
OR
mvn package - P maven Enterprise -ear  ie we want build only the maven enterprise-EAR package






1:16 
FOR ARTIFACT  to be created maven has to be installed and for us to be able to pull clone the codes from github, in our build server we hv to yum install git 



1:32:17 
the child pom.xml is referring to the parent which means thers can of an intersection, so when you run mvn build all those pom.xml will be ultilized




  1:00 
how can we trouble -shoot a fail build in MAVEN ??
Check the logs to understand the errors
mvn - x package (BUILD in debugging mode) This will build in debugging mode 


1:24 there are some issues i can TS as a devops engineer AND there are some issue i will escalate to the developers that this build is not responding pls correct them 
accordingly or pls modify the project file ie pom.xml


1:24:54

if you are doing a build and you are not doing it in the project file the build will fail or in a diff dir it wont work 
you must be in the project directory 




      TOMCAT
   

    Tomcat listens on port 8080

what is the function of tomcat 


engr Amstrong said we know if tomcat is installed by running start tomcat



webserver expects traffic to come on http or 443,
when the users are trying to access the appserver they are making some request on the port number either 80 or 443 


IQ: What is the d/f b/w JBoss/WildFly and Tomcat? 
    
1)vendors: Tomcat==Apache  
             JBoss=Redhat  
    
 2) Applications:          
        JBoss; Web applications .WAR 
               enterprise applications .ear 
        Tomcat; web applications ONLY 


1:11:00
****** the difference between
[ec2-user@tomcat tomcat9]$ sh /opt/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh
this is the absolute path starting the root directory

          WHILE
[ec2-user@tomcat tomcat9]$ sh startup.sh (says no such file or dir)
this is the relative path starting the pwd

 
IQ; if you want to access this server its going to be on port 80:80, so we check from our CLI if tomcat is running by
   curl -v public ip80:80 OR curl -v localhost:8080


IQ: we can change the DEFAULT PORT NUMBER OF TOMCAt in server.xml/configuration file  ***** whenever we change anything in the config file we have to restart tomcat
To enable external tomcat mgt access vi or vim  /opt/tomcat9/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
next we create tomcat user with access roles: vi or vim  /opt/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-user.xml  


   WAYS TO DEPLOY IN TOMCAT 
1) already saved file/artifact in my computer
he already has war file on his computer,so on the browser he clicked on deploy then in mobaxterm(CLI)
ls   /opt/tomcat9//webapps                                                                                  
we see the file copied into the webapp dir 


     option2)       DePLOYING FROM SERVER TO SERVER (Maven to tomcat)
 
we want to copy the file from our build server maven to tomcatserver
secure copy
A)if my server is not password authentication enabled
we run the scp command in maven                                  
scp -i c32.pem  target/*war ec2-user@tomcat public ip:/opt/tomcat9/webapps/
B)if password authentication is enabled
 we run this:   scp target/*war ec2-user@34.219.51.216:/opt/tomcat9/webapps/  


 WE ASSIGN PASSWORD TO MAVEN & TOMCAT SERVER  ( bY COnfiguring password authentication)
 sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config


 HOW TO IMPROVE TOMCAT SERVER PERFORMNACE 

1) multiple request on a single tomcat server will affect performance
2)  Multiple deployments will reduce tomcat server performance.
  therefore its recommended  tohave multiple tomcat server 
3) The resource level or computing capacity OF your tomcat server   
     8GB RAM,   480GB Hard drive HDD  is better than 64GB RAM,  4000GB Hard drive SSD   

  2:39:10
4) HDD hard drive  is/are of less performnace than SSD

5) HEAPSIZE 
  We can increase the heapsize of the server 
Normally, tomcat by default allocates 64mb but we can increase to 128mb/256mb
  heapsize = 64mb -- 128mb/256mb    


IQ: CAN WE  RUN TOMCAT AND MAVEN IN ONE SERVER

YEs you can but its  not recommended because it can lead to one single point of failure ie if maven server is down, tomcat also goes down , if tomcat has a problem, 
maven is also down 



CONTENT OF BIN DIR
conf: 

eg of files in conf:
     server.xml          
      tomcat-users.xml, users.xml for those that work in the bank
               contains configuration information about tomcat server, any changes can be done here


    lib :
        contain all the jar files

    logs :   contains log files
      catalina.out
      host-manager.log


IQ:  What are the log files available in the tomcat log dir?
      catalina.out                     ****** check here if tomcat is not running
      host-manager.log  


Tomcat Home directory - THD = /opt/tomcat9
THD: The Tomcat Home Directory is 
     where the tomcat software is extracted 
      we used wget to download tomcat  
      and unzip  to extract




IQ:  What are the log files available in the tomcat log dir?
      catalina.out                     ****** check here if tomcat is not running
      host-manager.log      



port number or server addresses:

    80  -- http     , Hyper text  transfer protocol
    443 -- https
    8080 -- Jenkins / Tomcat  / JBoss
    0-1024 -- Reserve ports
    1025-65535  
    465 --- SMTP
    587  --- SMTP
    22   --- ssh
    23   -- ftp
a server has 65536 ports/addresses    


2:15.35
IQ: WHAT IS UNPACKING
/opt/tomcat9/webapps/
when u deploy it copies the war file into the webapps dir and unpack it
unpack means eg when we copied the file we copied maven-web-app but when it goes to 'webapp dir',its extracting, & we see /app & app.war (app.war is red)why?
so when u do deployment u are copying this war file into the webapps dir and when its gets ther its automatically extracted which means its unpacked. 

*** 2:19:20;  WORKING DOCS 
  THE binary files in the bin dir like catalina.sh helps us to start and stop tomcat
as a matter of fact thats where (bin dir abi cataina file) the command shud be run from but bc we created a symbolic path we can start& stop tomcat frm 
anywhere in our env eg we can start it from anywhere by just by saying start/stop
the name can be anything decided by the coy 
and thats why you always hv running notes to ease your job 




SONAR
  QUESTION

IQ: Tell us a project/change you introduce in your environment 
    which you are proud of.
    Answer = I introduce sonarqube for code quality and am proud of it because it has enabled us to develop quality software and it has reduced the number of code breaks ,
bugs and roll backs




NGINX TOMCAT


load balancers helps to 
1)load balancers
                                                                    users >>> LB >>>> APP >>>> DB
2)security: Acts like a layer of security ie if anyone is trying to hack into our app it can be stopped at this stage which is very important 
3)health check: if its routing traffic/load balancing to about 30servers it ensures that it does not route traffic to a server that is not healthy, so it runs health check in 
the backend 
4)patching upgrading of our servers




HOW  DOES IT LOAD BAL OUR TRAFFIC 
The default option: to uses to bal traffic is called: Round robin:
Request/traffic is distributed evenly accross the servers , with server weight taken into consideration, ngnix will be routing traffic to this backend servers depending on the load traffic will be distributed equally.
Least connections:  A request is sent to the server with the least no of active connectors , also server weight is considered
iP hash: eg, we can decide that Ip address from Africa let it go to appserver1, Ip address of America let it go to server2 etc
the server to which a request is sent is determined from the client IP address


    HOW WE SUSTAIN THE MAINTENANCE PERIOD
26:59
if a server is down or undergoing maintenance/ upgrading it, vi the config file and write : "down" beside the server ip address
28.15.....   afterwhich we run   
nginx -t to ensure the configuration is valid  then
nginx -s reload
system ctl restart ngnix
we reload the server and we see traffic is nt routed to it again bc it doesnt come up with the other ip address
we can put aserver down when we are upgrading or patching

Also for the server we want to allocate more traffic we will write "weight =4", 
eg
we have 5m requests/users, we can assign  1m to the other server with 8GB  and 4M to that server with 64GB, ie 4x the number of users
then reloaad

35.00, so in real time we will nt be exposing our application directly for endusers traffic, we are going to use a proxy 


QUESTION
i know we hv lB in AWS , THAT means if we are nt using nginx, we can use AWS LB
yes
and rhats what we will see when we get to k8 and AWS 
but its ver imp that you get the picture first
bc why do we need a webserver or Load balancer
load balancers helps to 
1)load balancers
                                                                    users >>> LB >>>> APP >>>> DB
2)security: Acts like a layer of security ie if anyone is trying to hack into our app it can be stopped at this stage which is very important 
3)health check: if its routing traffic/load balancing to about 30servers it ensures that it does not route traffic to a server that is not healthy, so it runs health check in 
the backend 
4)patching upgrading of our servers


 DO WE CONSIDER THE TYPE OF LOAD BALANCER OR IT DOESNT MATTER AT THIS TIME
39.45 at this point we are not considering the type of lb , bt for you to explain in an interview that you hv experience in ngnic webserv is very imp
bc we are going to be doing other managed loadbalancer like ELB
once u understand this aspect of it that too will be easy for you to understand


40.20you werw spekaing and said the nginx will be in the publuc subnet 
my question is if there are 2 available zones, does that mean there wil be 2 nginx in the 2 availabilty zones??

********* ANS 
if you have a VPC : virtual private cloud ie your private netwrk, in this private network you can have about 6subnets depending on the region 
lets assume you have 6subnets
so now we have 3private subnets and 3public subnets
take note this is smt we will stilll look at
now in aws global resources you have:
   global >>> Regions >>> Availability zone 
inside AZ you ahve data centers                               ****** or 18 servers 3 in each Azs
when you create a vpc where you want to launch your resources, assuming you want to create your VPC in US East1 ie us virginia, it has 6 diff AZs meaning that i can create
my 6subnets/servers in all this availabity zones to ensure high availability
if i have my ngnix webserver running in the public subnet, Take note that all these severs are in the same vpcs so they are in the same netwrk thefore nginx webserver can route traffic to all the servers/ec2s since all the servers are
in the same vpc they are in the same netwrk,
45:39  so my ngnix can laod bal traffic to all servers or ec2s running in both private and public subnet

43:07 But if we have vpc1 and vpc2 , to ensure that connection happens we are goin to do vpc pairing so that even though they are in diff netwrk the pairing puts them  in the 
same netwrk that way you can still use a webserver to load bal traffic accross all your servers and this is the adv of using aws


45.43  SO WE BASICALLY DO THIS CONFIGURATION & CREATE A DOCKER IMAGE WHICH WE CAN USE AND DEPLOY AND LINK WITH TOMCAT IMAGE AS WELL
ANS;
Dnt worry you are going to see the amplified version of what have explained here in k8
its just you may work in an org that is not yet implementing microservices as expected 
bc the app we dploy, we deploy in virtual machines 
so if you work in such coy or u hv task that relate to monolitic appl running in virtual machines , you shud understand how that traffic will can be routed
understanding this wil help you easily understand ingress when wwe get to k8



47:00 ... if a user wants to access any of those applications, are they going to be using their individual ips or virtual ip of the ngnix 

ANS:
Before when users want to access their application they have to access individual servers ip but now we have to put all of them under one ngnix webserver, so all the traffic 
via the ngnix webserver .
they dont have to type https://3.090.240/app/ but now, mylandmark/register


48:20
A service in aws we are going to do called DNS
Route 53 = DNS  ( Domian Name Service )
                                                                                                                                                               alias name
if u have dns, we go to our route 53 &create hosted zone, in this zone we will be routing the traffic, instaed of users to type 3.40.21, they can type www.landmark.org/app
traffic will be routed to to this backend application server bc we have configured Route53 with a public domain name or alias name for our ngnix address, so if you want to 
access this application its either you type the ngnix ip address directly or the public domain name we created

49.32  CONFIGURING ROUTE 53

 
52:00
IQ       WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TYPE  app.com or google.com    (domain name service)
54:30
  once you type google.com it going to query global DNS searching for the webservers that are associated to this hostname and once it locates the server, immediately traffic
will be routed to that server


for example, why you type www.landmark.org, what happens is that in the backend you are going to query global DNS(global Domain name service) and there is a command is the 
backend called NS look up, it is going to be searching for the server.

53:15
eg    if i run nslookup www.landmark.org shows the address of our ngnix webserver

                                                
                                          WHAT CAN MAKE A SERVER UNHEALTHY/ TO FAIL
56:00

1) There could be a spike in the CPM, lets assume that a lot of processes are running in the server or the server is receiving a lot of traffic, it may not be haelthy to 
recieve additional traffic . and thats one of the reason that can make a server to be unhealthy

2)if for some reason the java process is not running in the tomact server, if java is not running, tomcat not to start, if you deploy appl you cant access it so if java 
process fail, it can make a server to be unhealthy and as such the webserver will not route to  traffic to an unhealthy target n thats why  when it comes to loadbalancing 
 its  very important with ngnix bc it has all this advantages


   QUESTION
1)the same way we installed ngnix on Redhat, can we do it on ubuntu

ANS: YES we can

2) why will you always prefer we install those app on Redhat, why nt using ubuntu

ANS: its justbc i wnat you guys to understand both redhat and ubuntu, when we inastlled doecker, we installed it on ubuntu and tomorrow we ill configure k8 on ubuntu
so but its good for you to have both exposure Redhat and ubuntu

NEXUS


What can be done if the packages are deleted IN MAVEN?
What can be done if the packages can't be access 
because the build server is down?

ANS:

DISASTER MGT/DISASTER RECOVERY

in our environment, once the artifacts are created in maven, we upload the jar packages, war and ear to the artifactory
In a situation where the MAVEN server goes down in the deployment, we just discontinue the process and pull from our artifactories that's how we manage the 
end to end process


WHAT IS NEXUS

Nexus: Is an Open source Artifactory Repository, It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts, We can retrieve artifacts when needed
       Nexus acts as a Disaster recovery server for maven    

JFrog: Is an  Artifactory Repository - it is Licence
       It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts 



                                    HOW HAVE YOU APPLIED NEXUS IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT

IQ: How have you applied Nexus in your environment?

    have been able to setup and install 
    1. Installation and configuration of the nexus server in Redhat.  
    2. Creating maven-remote-repos[artifactories] in nexus   
    3. uploading java, NodeJs, etc. artifacts into Nexus
    5. retrieving packages from Nexus
    4. Securing the nexus server   
    5. troubleshooting build and uploading related issues  
      Trying to integrate maven & configuring wrong credentials or wrong nexus IP address




QUESTION 
How will MAVEN connect with nexus?
maven and nexus intergration:


QUESTION  
is there a situation that require/necessitate the nexus repo not to allow update???? 
like when you had to changing the setting from disable to enable, why is that setting necessary even??? 
ANS 
You know we hv releasssses and snapnap
releases is when developerrs are done with the job, it has been tested and ready for production, most of the time if we are goin to deploy from there then we need to create a new vesrion bc we are ready for .deployment
thefore not allowing update means that if ur trying to redeploy or its like you hvv version 1.1 runnin, then you should go and crEate version 1.2 bc now you are set to deploy to production and if thers a problem you can roll back to 
version 1.1 but if you IF You dnt choose that option it means when you run mvn deploy, you upload and just update the same asset and in that case you cant rool back if thers a problem






**********  from bootcamp Dec26


42:34                     WALK US THROUGH YOUR ARTIFACTS MG8 WITH NEXUS 

   cAN YOU USE THE ANSWER TO THIS QUestion as a project your working on 
like tell us a project you are managing at the moment


ANS:

My project at the moment for the past 6nmths, i hv been tasked, am basically incharge of managing our artifacts 

is that a serious task to mg8 artcifacts 

what is the mg8 of artifacts ?? what does it involve 
walk me tru your artifacts management with nexux

45:40
thank you very much for that question
when it comes to artifacts, its very imp in the software development lifecycle and the way artifacts are managed bc artifacts are deployable  packages
packages that  appl servers  can understand, can interpret , thats what artifacts are all about

so in our env we use nexus to mg8 artifacts alongside our build servers which is jenkins on our pipeine 
so when artifacts acre created those artifacts are uploaded into nexus
so as part of my task, hv been able to setup a nexus server 
and in our env i was tasked to setup a nexus server on a redhat9 instance, i have done that before on REDhat8 and 7 instances , where ill donwload the 
software of nexus
and ill extract the software , when that happen, i hv nexus running on my pipeline , one hv installed nexus i ensure that nexus has started, its running
afterwhic i go to the nexus url , nexus account and i create repositories/artifactories wherewher artifacts can be uploaded into and generally i create both
snapshot repositories and releases repositories, the repositories is where i will upload my artifacts into 
again for the artifacts to be created, it rQuires dependencies, it requires pluggins , so hv equally used nexus as my maven proxy refactory where artifacts
are not directly gotten frm the maven central repository ,that is to say pluggins and depencies for us to be able to create artifacts can only be gotten
into our build server via the proxy server which runs in neuxs
its also worth explaning that hv equally been able to upload diff classes of artifacts including:
jar/war/ear , npm ie for node js applictaion, docker images 

                                      



         EXAMPLES OF ARTIFACTS

we are going to be creating an artifactory repository in maven where we can upload artifacts
  **********To install in windows, choco install tree
   
Examples of artifacts:    
in maven we can create an artifactory repository where we can upload artifacts
this artifactory can store  jar/war/ear artifacts/packages
Artifactory Repository    packages                      :
  maven Repository       [jar/war/ear] 
  NodeJs Repository      [npm, node packages ]   if we have a NodeJS project we are managing = Node Repo:npm node packages
  yum   Repository       [ yum packages]                   ****** this is meant for holding and managing RPM packages, so when you run the 
                                                     yum install,the command goes to the yum repo and search for the free package or any package you want to install
  chocolatey repo.       [choco packages]        
  apt  Repository        [ apt packages]
  docker
  terraform
