                                                           WHAT A PLATFORM ENGR DOES


19:30
IDP:
integrated development platform 


26:55
we hv actually done a lot in terms of system engr bc we hv created systems from scratch  
as far as you hv hv created and automated a system from scratch , that is a working platform then your platform engr


29:10  
when i had my eks cluster , i still hv the cluster running   inorder to minimize cost , he went to his service changed his LB to not pod
so ideallly if i was typically working situation thats a platfrm setup already so any other mmeber of team can use it for subsequent projects.

some one said the same tin applies to github where you aassign them password , github is now your platform when your using github to version and pull the code with github

platform is ontop of infrastructure

In reality most of the task that engr finally end up doing kind of interconnect to the diff job that you can do 
if u realise tru out devops engineering we hv been exposed to diff ssoftwares or technologies so we hv our technology stack and the technology stack u can talk about 
begining frm the end, ansible ,terfrm , k8, prmotheus and grafan, docker, tomact, jenkins etc
if u realisee whenevr we are trying to install any of this software, attimes we make a clause like this software supports multi platform ie eg you wnat to talk abt jenkins
jenkins can be installed across multiple platforms and what are these platforms , i can install jenkins in a jenkins system thats a linux platform , i can install jenkins on
a windows system thats a windows platform, so as a platform engr that falls more into what we call system engineering 
platfrom is more of system enginering so u can wrk as a systems admin eg you hv a mastery on hw to perfrm task on a linux system 
you can either be a linux adminstrator, linux engineer or a platform engineer focusing on linux, which means if ur asked to install jenkins on linux system you can do it bc 
you master linux platfrom , you can run task on linux platform with ease bc you hv a kinda of experience when it comes to perfrming task on linux, so ur talking abt linux 

lets assume you asre equally able to perfom the same task on , if u are able to install install tomcat on linux, on windows on solaris system, in that case u are not just a
platform engr, you are a multi platform engr , bc if u wrk in coy n ur asked to install java on linux system u can , on windows u can, on solaris system u can , so that 
makes you a multi platform engr
thats why if you look at your resume thers where are some jobs wher we put system administrator linux  or linux system admin , its like saying your aplatform engr bt focused on 
linux so if u say ur a platform engr what did you do as a platform engr

now when it comes to traditionally managing a linux platform what have you done on a linux system 
there are multiple stuffs you can do on a linux system 
one of it is package manger,  being able to install packages , unstall packages , its like you can commission, decommisssion nad decommission a aservr
whcih implies that you could be tasked create a  linux ubuntu server in aws or create an ubuntu server and install apache webserver , you can install and uninstall apache 
that means you are able to do that comfortably on a linux system

the fact that you can mg8 task on a linux system, it makes you a systems engr on that system , inorderwords it makes you a platform engr, you can wrk on the linux platform,
you have enough exp whne it comes to linux
like somebody say , you can bootstrap software that means you are able to install a software and you configue, you setup such that if you stop your server and restart that 
software will restart automatic
eg  if u install apache http server, the server has beeen installed but if u dnt enable the service, if you just start the service you are goin to be able to access apache as
long as the server is running but if the server is no longer runing then u can no longer access apache and that becomes a problem
so you task on that platform is not just about package mg8, you could have a mastery on how to mg8 users on the platform , user mgt
you can create users, modify users, grant sudo access to users, deny sudo priviledges etc

 THE NEXT QUESTION IS AS A PLATFORM ENGR HOW HV YOU BEEN ABLE TO PERFROM THIS TAKSK ???
        How do we perform task on a normal system be it windows, be it linux , etc

ANS:
Generally either u want to go via the console bc, there are softwares i can install on my linux system and it wil permit me to mg8 my linux system form the console eg u can 
create user fmr the console, u can do evrytin fmr the console by installing the software that will permit you to access your linux server as if you are accessing your aws 
account  that is now using console to mg8 that particular linux platfrm

its just like when we create jibs in jenkins we are workinh on a platfrm and the platfrm has a software called jenkins installed
we can mg8 jenkins frm end to end on our browser it has consloe asccess it has console access when u want to run job u must not go n use command line ther is what is called 
jenkins CLI where u can run jenkins job frm the command line bt since the console gives you that privilrdge as well you can now the console to perfrm the same 
so you can run task on a linux or windows system using 
1)console
2) CLI
3)we can use a script
4) we USE aansible playbook 

cos as someone said if u are a platfrm engr the u have a good mastery of ansible bc with ansible you are able to automate hw to run certain task on a fleet of thats when 
we hv a group of linux servers which we hv classified as our app servers and we want to create users on them, with one ansible playbk we can create users on all those servers
at once and that is you perfrming platfrm engeering task but taking advantage of automation and since devops is all abt automation that means means you are perfrorming devops
engineering task but you are automating the process, you are using ansible to automate the task frm end to end 

devops is more on the automation side, how to get everything automated in all of this, so if you want to consider the diff jobs that u can do platfrm engnering is one of them 


           YOU MAY WANT TO ASK PROFF WHATDO YOU DO AS A SITE RELIABILITY ENGINEER ????

As a site reliabilty engineer , Now you wrk in a site , its just like you wrk in a coy and u ar made the field manger or you are made a supervisor  so as a supervisor
u are suppose to ensure that those that those that are suppose to carry out certain task are carrying the task our as expected or as desired so what do you do, at all times
you must ensur that evrybody is perfroming the desired task , so what do u do , now we have an appliaction that is suppose to sevre cx, so u are a site reliability engineer
you are managing an online banking application , that appl enabes cx to carryout transactions, they shud be able to carry out a couple of task vis that appl, but if that app
is not running cx will start complaining , so may tickets will be created, so as a site relaibilty engineer , you are more on the observation side of things , you wnat to
obsevere, we call that observabilty, you are observing, monitoring, is my app working, is there anything we can do that means you need to be heavy when it comes to 
monitoring system, monitoring tools like promethus, newrelic , so those are imp stuff to take note of 

so these are some of the few things for you to have a good end to end insight on it 

QUESTION
this platform engineers can i still say they are solution architect  ???

to an extent today they can be bc there have been a global transition
now in the past, when we call you a system engineer, you are manging either physical servers which are running in mayb the coy data center, you hv to mk sure that physically 
they are runnning, now on those physical servers we hv to install what is called virtualization softwares like vm ware, virtual box, now once you install those virtualization
software thats a hypervisor which wll permit us to create like multiple virtual server on one physical server so you could have one physical server and on that you have like 
20 virtual servers installed, like i can hv a windows sytem and on that window system i hv 20 other linux systems running on it 
now when you hv such a system by the time you want to create a virtual server you hv to decide hw much memory, hw much cpu ,interms of disk  usage that u want to assign to
that particular virtual sevrer, but now if thet server is running short of , RAM for eg memory, cpu, what will you do ?????
you have to ensure that the server got sufficient resources to support the applications that are running on it, you may hv to do what is called  LVM, logical volume mgt,that
could now permit YOU to increase volume and all of that 

but today, that particular task is now manged mostly from a cloud infrastructure and that is why today u need more cloud enginers than simply linux administrator so if you 
call yourself solution architect it means that you hv a mastery on hw to mg8 certain cloud services for eg which are the cloud services that u have managed
lets assume that you have been working on aws , on aws u have basically worked on ec2 instances
when u create an ecinstance what do you do, >>??? 
you hv to determine the netwrk, how that particular instance is, you hv to choose the particular vpc wher you wnat the intance to run, u hv to also choose the subnet.
that is you carrying out that task, it doenst end about only the netwrk , you leave frm ther to decide hw much storage you enat to allocate to the instance, is it 30GB OR 60GB
ebs volume , what ever storage you wnat you have to now decide and again what will be the strength of your instance, computing capacity, is it going to have  5G, 8GB of RAM, 
those are factors that you hv to consider and this factors are key factors in decison making 


but now as a solution architect, i hv assigned 80GB to my server, to my ec2 instance,  80GB of ebs volume . that is a block storage, it has been asssigned

so my root storage is runing on 80GB , i realise that my server needs more storage devices what can i do??? , can i create a volume, can i attach a new vol to my ec2 instance
the answer is yes if i do that what must i do, i hv to now proceed to mount it, theta entire procees of creating a new vol, attaching it and mounting it used to be avery 
cumber process when it comes to managing that task on a physicalsystem or even uisng hypervisor with virtual machines but today, cloud computing has simplified the end to end #
process such that if u are a solution architect these are some of the tsk that you can do

now aws as a coy they equally hire workers, if aws hire you today you may hv to wrk in their date center like as a solution architect and what will be your function??
most of the time you will be helping customers that hv problem, for gg landmark is a client of aws, we are using aws services, netflix is a client of aws, using aws to host 
their movies, if netflic has a particular problem for eg, they are goin to call aws that i hv this issue and netflix got what is called enterprise support , if they hv issues
aws will attend to them  and who will attend to them?? it wil be you working with aws, we hv a lot of our engineers that are perfrming such task with aws , goodle, micorsft
azure, that is their job ,, so pls take note,, but again most of these task with kind of connect with each other , whether u are are a cloud enr, devops engr, most of them will
intersect so tk note 





59;oo     her interview quetsion 30minutes
1st interview, technical team will interview, 



1;04:00
proff said up to $100 an hour ,, on an avg we can say $70 to $80 an hour as an individual contarctor 
full time role we talk abt anally salary
this role in particular, are ther any other benefits, personally this role for eg am going to be considering anything frm $150k a year and above
in europe u will be paid in euroes most folks wil talk abt 70k euroks a year and its the same in the uk , as well u wnat to talk abt 70 to 80 euro a year 
when it comes to us and canada bu since u can work any wher in the world you can wqually hv the option to earn what the US and canadians are earning 


1:07.20
HOW DO YOU ENSURE SECURITY IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT?? 


for security users should use IAM 

1:26:17   with IAM, u can decide what the user can do but with root access   the user can do everything 



1:35:17
the rule says we only provide least priviledgers to users we dnt provide full access 
so this is the security architecture  thers more to talk about security , this is just at the level of accessimg authentication
once you access, you have to create resources we need a netwrk so we ceate a vpc (virtual private cloud) 
In aws we create our own netwrk the netwrk needs to be secured .
inside the netwrk we can create other netwrks called subnet or subnetwrk and inside this netwrk, who can and who cant have access is also important 

our environment is heavy on security such that for eg we have a user called called Sam , and hes trying to ssh / hv access to our env , his traffic will go through
my vpc then frm there to the subnet then frm the subnet to server eg jumpserver so it goes through (2) layers of security 

so we have security at the subnet level called NAC and at the server level we have security groups, so all of this is sec


but again the main approach for you to explain in your answer is in our environment security is inherent and when it comes to our infrastructure we are leveraging 
resources in aws and we are using IAM user for our team members to have access to our aws resources and account we also ensure that team members are only granted least
previledges, least required priviledges thats what we do and when it comes to how our nfrastructure is configured from end to end, we equally look at them 
how do we configure our infrastructure, how is it configured from end to end is very important

as a matter of fact we hv a video called deveSECops, i hvshared that video in our class channel that video cover sthe diff layers of security as a matter of fact that video 
is going to be able to help get a job as a deveSEcops engr , its a 3 hrs video 




1:42:00
if u are working in landmark as an engr you are working with other engineers as a team, so thers always a team of abt 10 engineers that you guys work together 
which means that for eg we hv a project frm tesla to build the appl, develop the appl and deploy them 

NOW WHAT IS OUR JOB??
WE have a team of 10 of us , part of the team are developwers who are writing the code, implemetation thats their task then we have devops engr who is going to take the code 
and ensure that its goes tru a pipeline to be built and the whole process is automated for it to get to the client and we cud equally have a systems engr whose job is just to 
we sure that if we are working on linux or windows sys, those systems are runing as expected and if there are any issues he or she is resolving them .
we could equally hv somebody who is in charge of security devesecops engr hes ther to ensure that whatevr action we are taking security is not comporised, so in all our
meetings, hes trying to check this action will ther be any vulnerabilty, this step we want to take is ther any risk of hacking. so pls tk note its very important
