                                                           WHAT A PLATFORM ENGR DOES

IDP:
integrated development platform

we hv actually done a lot in terms of system engr bc we hv created systems from scratch 
as far as you hv hv created and automated a system from scratch , that is a working platform then your platform engr

when i had my eks cluster , i still hv the cluster running   inorder to minimize cost , he went to his service changed his LB to not pod
so ideallly if i was typically working situation thats a platfrm setup already so any other mmeber of team can use it for subsequent projects.

some one said the same tin applies to github where you aassign them password , github is now your platform when your using github to version and pull the code with github

platform is ontop of infrastructure

the fact that you can mg8 task on a linux system, it makes you a systems engr on that system , inorderwords it makes you a platform engr, you can wrk on the linux platform,
you have enough exp whne it comes to linux
like somebody say , you can bootstrap software that means you are able to install a software and you configue, you setup such that if you stop your server and restart that 
software will restart automatic
eg  if u install apache http server, the server has beeen installed but if u dnt enable the service, if you just start the service you are goin to be able to access apache as
long as the server is running but if the server is no longer runing then u can no longer access apache and that becomes a problem
so you task on that platform is not just about package mg8, you could have a mastery on how to mg8 users on the platform
you can create users, modify users, grant sudo access to users, deny sudo priviledges etc

 ANOTHER QUESTION IS AS A PLATFORM ENGR HOW HV YOU BEEN ABLE TO PERFROM THIS TAKSK ???
        How do we perform task on a normal system be it windows, be it linux , etc

ANS:
Generally eithr u want to go via the console bc, there are softwares i can install on my linux system and it wil permit me to mg8 my linux system form the console eg u can 
create user fmr the console, u can do evrytin fmr the console by installing the software that will permit you to access your linux server as if you are accessing your aws 
account  that is now using console to mg8
