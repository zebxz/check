whena server is created, ders a piece of storage attached to it, wich is mounted on the server n its called ebs , block store n its has an advantage ie it is elastic 
7:10 #####not clear its going to be mouning among others within a root file system..

the block storage is unique, bc the ebs on webserver1 cannot be transferrd to webser2 bc they ar blocked to the server  

????? for vol settings whats the diff btw general purpose ssd2 and ssd3 
??????  sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins ..... why the -p

storage solutions:
  ebs volume  = block store
       Required mounting    
       
  efs  volume = file storage
       Required mounting 
       sudo yum install nfs-utils
     
  s3 bucket   = object storage 

[ec2-user@web ~]$ lsblk  .... list block command to list the blocks,,, in the lsblk command, we hv our root file system... ie xvda1
NAME      MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
xvda      202:0    0   8G  0 disk......... jst one disk & its a block store 21:50
├─xvda1   202:1    0   8G  0 part /
├─xvda127 259:0    0   1M  0 part
└─xvda128 259:1    0  10M  0 part /boot/efi

#######16:57 for my file sys i can also execute df -h, we can see xvda1 is mounted on our root file system ie /dev/xvda1

Root [/] directory has other sub-directories
  /bin /home /etc/ /var /opt / ... this is a root file system

Ticket0048:
  Create, attached & mount 5G to the /tesla directory 
  Create, attached & mount 7G to the /var/lib/jenkins directory 

files ar mounted frm d root dir bc /root is wher all oda dir starts bt can i create a specific storage for /teslas? yes

the volume to be created can be as large as 16 terabyte
#38:00 volume state says volume is available so i can attach d vol to an instance , then vol stae changes to in use. can also modify vol by inresing its size bt cant decrea
we can modify while volume is in use
##42:14 we can increase from 14gb to 18GB ie VERTICAL increase, 
mounting is attaching to the server so dat files can be saved on the file system

Creating ebs volume    
Attaching EBS  
Mounting ebs:
 to know the file sys  ,, ie if it has any file or jst an empty dvf
1. sudo file -s /dev/xvdf

to list all file systems
     sudo lsblk -f
 
 to create the file system for the vol
2. sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
    sudo yum install xfsprogs  ... if it says command nt found

 to create a mount point dir for vol3. sudo mkdir /data
    sudo mkdir /app   bt mk sure /app or /data doesnt exists
 
to mount
 3. sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
    sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /data
    sudo mount /dev/xvdf2 /data 

 4. sudo unmount /dev/xvdf /data

Create, attached & mount 7G to the /var/lib/jenkins directory  ... all our jenkins job will be found here

sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdg
 sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins
sudo mount /dev/xvdg /var/lib/jenkins/

 
EFS:
====
Volume expansion - vertical   [4gb-->7gb] 
Volume expansion - horizontal [v1=8g, v2=7g, v3=6g]  

Traditional volume mgt and LVM use to require SystemsAdmin  
skills to perform. Today cloud computing skills are required to 
simplify and automate the process

Lambda functions:
=================  
  If we have upto  75% volume usage increase vol by 20%   
  df -h / 100G/75G  -- 120G 

Disaster Recovery:  
 cross account 
    aws account1 = email/password [root access]
       database servers running   

    aws account2 = email/password [root access]  
      backup database servers in account2 

We created a snapshot lifecycle policy using Lambda  which
create sonapshots from our databases from account1 in account2
 cross region   

efs : file storgae 

efs  volume = file storage / SHARED Storage
     Required mounting 
     sudo yum install nfs-utils

google drive-400G = legah@gmail.com  
files: documents, pictures, videos 
mounted on: phones, tablets, computers  

NFS = Network file system  = self managed   
EFS = Elastic File system  = managed by AWS 


Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple,
 scalable, elastic file system for general purpose 
 workloads for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
