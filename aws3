whena server is created, ders a piece of storage attached to it, wich is mounted on the server n its called ebs , block store n its has an advantage ie it is elastic 
7:10 #####not clear its going to be mouning among others within a root file system..

the block storage is unique, bc the ebs on webserver1 cannot be transferrd to webser2 bc they ar blocked to the server  


  

storage solutions:
  ebs volume  = block store
       Required mounting    
       
  efs  volume = file storage
       Required mounting 
       sudo yum install nfs-utils
     
  s3 bucket   = object storage 

[ec2-user@web ~]$ lsblk  .... list block command to list the blocks,,, in the lsblk command, we hv our root file system... ie xvda1
NAME      MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
xvda      202:0    0   8G  0 disk......... jst one disk & its a block store 21:50
├─xvda1   202:1    0   8G  0 part /
├─xvda127 259:0    0   1M  0 part
└─xvda128 259:1    0  10M  0 part /boot/efi

#######16:57 for my file sys i can also execute df -h, we can see xvda1 is mounted on our root file system ie /dev/xvda1

Root [/] directory has other sub-directories
  /bin /home /etc/ /var /opt / ... this is a root file system

Ticket0048:
  Create, attached & mount 5G to the /tesla directory 
  Create, attached & mount 7G to the /var/lib/jenkins directory 

files ar mounted frm d root dir bc /root is wher all oda dir starts bt can i create a specific storage for /teslas? yes

Attaching EBS  
Mounting ebs:
 1. sudo file -s /dev/xvdf

     sudo lsblk -f
 
 2. sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
    sudo yum install xfsprogs

 3. sudo mkdir /data
    sudo mkdir /app   

 3. sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
    sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /data
    sudo mount /dev/xvdf2 /data 

 4. sudo unmount /dev/xvdf /data

EFS:
====
Volume expansion - vertical   [4gb-->7gb] 
Volume expansion - horizontal [v1=8g, v2=7g, v3=6g]  

Traditional volume mgt and LVM use to require SystemsAdmin  
skills to perform. Today cloud computing skills are required to 
simplify and automate the process

Lambda functions:
=================  
  If we have upto  75% volume usage increase vol by 20%   
  df -h / 100G/75G  -- 120G 

Disaster Recovery:  
 cross account 
    aws account1 = email/password [root access]
       database servers running   

    aws account2 = email/password [root access]  
      backup database servers in account2 

We created a snapshot lifecycle policy using Lambda  which
create sonapshots from our databases from account1 in account2
 cross region   

efs : file storgae 

efs  volume = file storage / SHARED Storage
     Required mounting 
     sudo yum install nfs-utils

google drive-400G = legah@gmail.com  
files: documents, pictures, videos 
mounted on: phones, tablets, computers  

NFS = Network file system  = self managed   
EFS = Elastic File system  = managed by AWS 


Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple,
 scalable, elastic file system for general purpose 
 workloads for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
