in k8 we use namespace to isolate clusters ............. class 33 vdeo7a

we can use a vscode to help when it comes to the manifest file 
but we also hv a github repository that conatins almost all the manifest file tha you may need
prof is there any file you have written that i can go there and copy and use them even at work? ...YES
CLONE THIS REPOSITORY
https://github.com/LandmakTechnologies/Kubernetes-manifests    .... almost everytin that we v done so far u wil find it here, when ur trying to deploy appli
                                                    most of the tins that we v been able to cover in k8, u can see then here, like hw to deploy in mysql db 
                                                       with configmap and secret , all of that, al d manifest files that we wil stil be loking at u wil find 
                                                                      them there when it comes to k8

                                             CREATING POD & MAKING USE OF REQUEST, RESOURCE & LIMIT
one tin i wanted us to look at .... creating a pod and making use of request, RESOURCE,and limit
when YOu want to create a resourec in k8 generally, we need to decide hw much resources is goin to be asssigned
when you assign resources to your pod for that pod to be scheduled on a node, the node must have the requested resources available.

**bt while d container is running, if d container need to optimize d resource d  maximum d conatiner can use is what has been defined as limit

after we deploy the file below 
kubectl describe , if u look at this pod, the pod has a imit as to hw much resources it can consume in a clutser
this are key aspect when it comes to auto scaling our pod , so if we wnat to deploy our apply, we can deploy it making use of REQ and limit as we v seen here


Resource, requests and limits:
--------------------------
Requests and limits are the mechanisms Kubernetes uses to control resources such as CPU and memory. 
Requests are what the container is guaranteed to get. 
If a container requests a resource, 
Kubernetes will only schedule it on a node that can give it that resource.

                                 WHAT IS LIMIT
Limits, on the other hand, make sure a container never goes above
a certain value. The container is only allowed to go up to the limit, and then it is restricted.

Resource Limit:  .. a container wil never go above a certain value
A limit is the maximum amount of resources that 
Kubernetes will allow the container to use.

Resource request:
---------------
A request is the amount of that resources that the system will guarantee for the container, and Kubernetes will use this value 
to decide on which node to place the pod.
