The steps asa developer for our fintech client
   WORKING AREA (workshop) >>> STAGING AREA (show room) >>>> LOCAL REPOSITORY AND THE >>>>> REMOTE REPO 


1)Project Onboarding: 
   1. create a github account for your organisation or self & Create organisations where applicable
     then create repositories
share login details with Developers/Team [ userName/password ]

2  Git 
In our env, we use Git which is a Distributed Version Control systems. DVCS, we use Git for Versioning
we install git in our env, using diff package managers for either windows, Redhat Linux or Ubuntu linux server
A) create a directory for Development   
   mkdir paypal && cd paypal  
B) Initialise this directory to keep track of 
   any change or changes in the files/codes  ... by running git init
Git init creates a local repository and initializes the project directory

C) For git to track our work (In the working area we run git add)
 To move our files form our working area ( file appears in RED)to the staging area (File appears in GREEN)
git add.filename   TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORK IS TRACKED BY GIT, ((in orderwords, task in our working environment is not tracked by git)
TO create a file : vi OR touch filename
so we touch a file in our working area and move it

D)  TO COMMIT the changes
In our staging area  >>>>>>>>>>>> local repository
     git commit -m  "   "
( for data intergrity) for trcaking who did what
SO you have to be authenticated with the command;
  global configuration  ==  git config -- global usre.email "your email address'
                            git config  --- global user.name "yourname"
then we run git log to check , after which we run git commit -m  and git log again to check
E) local repository   >>>> Remote repository
       git push ( push changes from local environment to remote repository)
