**** windows is an operating system as linux and they all have commnd line 
in windows we can install Git (our DVCs) by downloading it while for linux; we login to mobaxterm and use package manager while utilizing sudo "sudo yum install git" to install git
 MobaXterm is a versatile and powerful tool for interacting with Linux systems from a Windows machine
git2.... 11:40 on git inmobaxterm we first cd documents/ then mkdir but on git in windows we mkdir and cd into it


The steps as a developer for our fintech client
   WORKING AREA (workshop) git add >>> STAGING AREA (show room) git commit >>>> LOCAL REPOSITORY AND THE (git push) >>>>> REMOTE REPO 
   Dvelopment takes place in the working area 

( i confirmed that the name of the directory you initialize must not be the same as the alias name you added as the name of the remote repo url in the local env/repo)
 the alias name make s it easy so u dnt have to type the enter repo url each time you wnat to push or pull


1)Project Onboarding: we onboard projects by;
   1. create a github account for your organisation or self & Create organisations where applicable
. Create organisations where applicable in a SCM ['GitHub']  
       url =  https://github.com/landmarkss
   3. Create teams in SCM/github and assign members[Developers, etc.]                   
     then create repositories, either public or private  .... git2.. 13.54
4. share login details with Developers/Team [ userName/password ]

2  Git installation ... DVCS
In our env, we use Git which is a Distributed Version Control systems. we use Git for Versioning
Git Installations differs depending on your operating system:

nxt step
A) create a directory for Development   
   mkdir paypal && cd paypal  
paypal is out project dir
B) Initialise this directory to keep track of 
   any change or changes in the files/codes  ... by running git init
Git init creates a local repository and initializes the project directory
so we are now in the local repository

***** Git status;  shows the state of the working directory and staging area, eg to know if the project directory has been initialized, to check if our working tree is clean or not
It lists: Tracked files (modified, staged, or deleted).


C) For git to track our work (In the working area we run git add)
 To move our files form our working area ( file appears in RED)to the staging area (File appears in GREEN)
git add.filename   TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORK IS TRACKED BY GIT, ((in orderwords, task in our working environment is not tracked by git)
TO create a file : vi OR touch filename
so we touch a file in our working area and move it

D)  TO COMMIT the changes
In our staging area  >>>>>>>>>>>> local repository
     git commit -m  "   "
( for data intergrity) for trcaking who did what
SO you have to be authenticated with the command;
  global configuration  ==  git config -- global usre.email "your email address'
                            git config  --- global user.name "yourname"
then we run git log to check , after which we run git commit -m  and git log again to check
E) we have To add a repository for git push
  To move files from local repository   >>>> Remote repository
       git push ( push changes from local environment to remote repository)
git remote -v    = to tell us if we have any repository detail in our local environment 
Tells us how many remote repository we are managing 
to add a repository  URL in our local environment 
      git remote add paypal https://github.com/zebxz/paypal     ( ie this repository url is been replaced by paypal "the alias name i created in  in my local enveiroment )
i had to use: git remote add pay https://github.com/bibiblee/pay    (Because zebxz/paypal refushed to accept the push 
************* at this point when we check in github, we cant see anything like the new version of the app in github/remote repository
we want our developers to collab with each other so we have to push

GIT PUSH      (alias Name )master
git push pay master 
will request for username and pssword but we hv to go to github and generate token because git doesnt accept password again  **** this was the case when we were still in class but when in 2025 the authenticatin wa sychronized by the system 
ie i was directed straight to github to be authenticated
***********  Now when we check in github, we can see the new version of the app in github/remote repository
F)7)   GIT PULL : to see the work others have added to the project i have to pull to my env

After the task i pushed has been executed/worked on by other developers
 === GIT PULL paypal master

    MANAGING APPLICATIONS
             APPLICATIONS ARE THE OUTPUT FROM SOFTWARES
We develops, tests, builds, deploy and monitors applications
our main focus is on development and when applications are developed multiple versions of the application can be developed
we need to use a version control system that brings all the advantages of version control and that is a distributed version control system bc it keeps and tracks record
There are other platforms we can use for SCM like git lab, git hub, git bucket and aws code commit


A branch is a line of development
                        GIT BRANCH
   one branch = 1line of production
A branch is a line of development 
 A file must have been moved to the staging area before it can be pushed
1:11:00 once we are done with the dev branch, we can create a new branch from dev called stage branch and whatsoever is in the dev branch will also be found in the dev and stage branch.
development branch : writing our code, once developers are satisfied they move it to the stage branch
stage branch : then moved to stage and once its done
master branch: deployed to production environment , taken to the market

****whatsoever is in dev branch is deployed to dev environment, from stage branch to  staging/testing/QA  and from master to production/market

***** in development its good to have multiple dev lines so that if there is an issue with one line, it can be resolved from the other line
 
******* The master branch is the upstream Branch for the dev Branch  
  The dev branch is the downstream of the master branch
