if you want to get rich, dnt focus on making money, focus on other things that provide valuable service, that add smt to the world, that gives you time to think
dnt spend all your time chasing money , thats what gives you the quote rich finacially, its not fcusing on getting rich 

its also true about dating life, its all those things that we dnt even associate with our dating life to add a tremedous impact on our dating life, like reading a book, and now
you have smt to talk abt on a date ..
