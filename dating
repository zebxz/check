1:34:00
            MAke your partner know what you expect from them before marriage 


                   
                        YOU DONT FIND YOUR PARTNER, YOU choose your partner , its very diff
2:23:25 :  we stay in an examined state, the fact that i have options doesnt mean i have to exercise it all 
 the problem of consumer life, we dnt know any more how to make choices , same with the cereal in the supermarket , why will it be diff with love 

                how do you know if when you find the right choice no you dont , u dnt find you choose 
2:23:55   if you think you are even going to find someone that will make you stop looking , no it doesnt start this way , bc in a moment of time you inner  rumblings willl 
start again and you end up looking...  ,  its like you just decide this is it, this is where i decide to put my root in this moment n am gonna try and deepen them 

  i think we are all living in a paradox of choice , but we cannot commodity a partner 


ther are a lot of people you can love but there a re a few you can make a life with but they are not always the same 
there are lot of people you can have magnificient love stories with but they not the people you can make a life with, they are just too diff from you, there are diff values ,

feelings are the magnetic charge in the cuntum field, and hw u think and hw u feel , broadcasts an electric signature that influences every single atom in your life, the
thought sends the signal out and the feeling is the magnetic field that draws the event back to you so if ur nt in a place where ur inlove with urself or inlove with life
or practising, diminishing your emotional reactions to certain people or conditions in your life and ur lving in anger or hostility or fear and u want want a loving 
relationship, thers no magnetic force for u to draw that to you
if u say its that person or that circumstance thats causing me to  feel this way
so person that circumatmace is controling the way u feel and think
and anything that controls the way we feel or think, we are victims to, so most people unconsciously responding to the conditions in their environment 
expeeriencing emotions that are derived form the harmones of stress, those emotions cause us to feel seperate frm our dreams, the heigthen our senses, so if we cant see
them they dnt esist, the threat or the danger puts us in emergency mode and we can think positively abt the relationship we wnt, we cud hv pictures etc bt if ur nt drawing the 
experience back to u bc ur response to env is actually weakening ur organism, its weakening ur response its actually weakening the body then ull be as a victim more vulnerable
to the conditions in yours env whetehr they are large or small
so if u wnat5 a relationship that is based on the ocncept of love , its s skill that has to tk place where u move out of survival

****** MONEY WILL FLOW LIKE CRAZY , Dr Joe Dispenza

its nt about ur healing its about your change 
people who have healed frm all kinds of chronic disese wil tell u it was never abt their healing, it was what do i do to change in order to heal
so when someone is feeling laack on some level, its nt just in the body, its in the mind 
when someone is looking for abundance, its nt abt the abundance, its abt the change they need to make 
the more i change the more i will be abundant , so its nt abt why it hasnt happen,thats the old personality
them word meditation means become familiar with , sit with urself long enough, dnt turn on your cell phone ,nt scroling on social media
just sit and dclose your eyes, those thoughts that come up, thats the excat reason why u are nt abundant 
watch what ur doing when ur feeling lack, to tk away the lack , sort of things u would do to tk away the lack 
bt sit with the lack , and be curious of whats on the other side of the lack 
bc the body is programmed into lack subconsciously , so the emotions of lack drives out thoughts, it drives our behaviours 
so it makes sense that if a emotion is a record of thr past, we are doing things arbirtually frm the past, we are thinking frm the past 
so lower the vol to the emotion evrytime u notice lack comes on
the body is always reminding the mind to return bk to the default
