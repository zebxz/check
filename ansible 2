in the real world 
it wil be a diff scenario that will REQ you to use that basic understaning
e.g they may say we hv a k8 cl8 that is runing in aws we nid to get a the cluster certificate form that cl8 bc we need it somewhere, if given that task so how wil you do it??

ANS: 
so now bc you understand the concept of, if you have a resource that exists you can get inf/attribute frm that resource, so u knw that i can use a data source, i can employ a 
data source that can specifically go into my eks cluster and return for me the certificate, so nmw thats a concept you understand so now you go to the documentation to see if
you have a datasource that acn access your k8 cluster and when it accesses what can it return, how many attributes can it return
again you just look at the documentation, if you use a datasource for eks cluster it will show you the tins that it can return, the inf it can get, so now when you have that 
concept you are goin to employ a data source to get all the inf that you need

but as we go further into the bootcamp everytin will be clearer the concept will solidify , and everything will make more sense

   ************6:00    importance of boot camp

preparation for transitioning into the bootcamp
cv  and linkedin preparation 
focused on project base so that everyting youv been doing al these concept is solididfied whereby you are doing projects
and we have other advanced concept thay you will be able to tour
helping you prepare for interviews, how your suppose to response


            QUESTION
1)  CAN WE create our resources in global instaed of regions and having issues,??

ANS:     ..NO
when your configuring you cant use global, we use a default , you must pass a region
e.g you want to create an ec2 instance , can you create that using the global option , it needs to be created in a specific region bc it needs to be created in a vpc
so the reason why we hv to pass a default is just incase in our configuration we are not specifying a region atleast aws is proactive to mk sure that your resource will be 
created somewhere, so thats why you hv to set that default region bc resources, most of the resources in aws are region based, we hv very limite global services like IAM
thats why when you go to create a user or a role it doesnt ask you for a region , S3 bucket is a global service bc you can access it frm any region but howeevr, when u go to 
create a bucket youhv to specify a region , bc most of the service are region specific so your reQ to pass a default region so that when a region is nt set in your 
configuration then either terfrm or whatever appli your using wil fall back on a region that has been set as a default
so thats why we cannot global aws configure set globally, we must have a region

2) dnt understand how you use count.index and slice in the previous video 
ANS:
we use count index whenever we hv count set 
ITS a meta argumnet which alters the behaiour of how a resource works
when you look at the element function ,that is the first element that we are passing to count, element function  wil always return a number 
when you look at the documentation its just goin to select an item fmr a list , so we are combing those functions
e.g
i hv 10 elemebts in a list and now am using a slice function so am goin to implore that slice function on this list, it has 10 things and i need a slice of 3, or i need to 
slice it so that i get 4 elemet out of the list so ill give the first like a 0, so it menas the slice wil count frm the first elemet to and count 4slices and return taht to 
me so that wil be the value of the count
