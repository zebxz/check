RECAP,  REMOTE DEVELOPMENT
 

2:30 
in the real world 
it wil be a diff scenario that will REQ you to use that basic understaning 
e.g they may say we hv a k8 cl8 that is runing in aws we nid to get a the cluster certificate form that cl8 bc we need it somewhere, if given that task so how wil you do it??

ANS: 
so now bc you understand the concept of, if you have a resource that exists you can get inf/attribute frm that resource, so u knw that i can use a data source, i can employ a 
data source that can specifically go into my eks cluster and return for me the certificate, so nmw thats a concept you understand so now you go to the documentation to see if
you have a datasource that acn access your k8 cluster and when it accesses what can it return, how many attributes can it return
again you just look at the documentation, if you use a datasource for eks cluster it will show you the tins that it can return, the inf it can get, so now when you have that 
concept you are goin to employ a data source to get all the inf that you need

but as we go further into the bootcamp everytin will be clearer the concept will solidify , and everything will make more sense

   ************6:00    importance of boot camp

preparation for transitioning into the bootcamp
cv  and linkedin preparation 
focused on project base so that everyting youv been doing al these concept is solididfied whereby you are doing projects
and we have other advanced concept thay you will be able to tour
helping you prepare for interviews, how your suppose to response


            QUESTION
1)  CAN WE create our resources in global instaed of regions and having issues,??

ANS:     ..NO
when your configuring you cant use global, we use a default , you must pass a region
e.g you want to create an ec2 instance , can you create that using the global option , it needs to be created in a specific region bc it needs to be created in a vpc
so the reason why we hv to pass a default is just incase in our configuration we are not specifying a region atleast aws is proactive to mk sure that your resource will be 
created somewhere, so thats why you hv to set that default region bc resources, most of the resources in aws are region based, we hv very limite global services like IAM
thats why when you go to create a user or a role it doesnt ask you for a region , S3 bucket is a global service bc you can access it frm any region but howeevr, when u go to 
create a bucket youhv to specify a region , bc most of the service are region specific so your reQ to pass a default region so that when a region is nt set in your 
configuration then either terfrm or whatever appli your using wil fall back on a region that has been set as a default
so thats why we cannot global aws configure set globally, we must have a region 


14:00
2) dnt understand how you use count.index and slice in the previous video 
ANS:
we use count index whenever we hv count set 
ITS a meta argumnet which alters the behaiour of how a resource works
when you look at the element function ,that is the first element that we are passing to count, element function  wil always return a number 
when you look at the documentation its just goin to select an item fmr a list , so we are combing those functions
e.g
i hv 10 elemebts in a list and now am using a slice function so am goin to implore that slice function on this list, it has 10 things and i need a slice of 3, or i need to 
slice it so that i get 4 elemet out of the list so ill give the first like a 0, so it menas the slice wil count frm the first elemet to and count 4slices and return taht to 
me so that wil be the value of the count
*********i can also slice frm the middle but say ill say the first slice/elent is 3, so it is goin to start frm 3 and count the 4 elements , 4,5,6,7 , so it will take that
port as the slice and return it to count

*********** the whole reason why we use count and (it becomes clearer in the both camp) we wnat to make our code more flexible, we dnt wnat to hard code values, we want such
that am nt harding coding anything, by putting a value as 2 or 3 on the count bc when i do that i have basically hardcoded it but i want that value of count to be detr by 
mayb d number of subnet so if i hv 5avaialbilty zones then i want the slice to be 5, if i have 3 availabity zones then i want the lsice to be 2 bc its dependent on something
else.

3) hOW do 2 or more engrs work on the same repo without causing a clash , in git we have branches , is it the same in terrafrm
ANS:
in your office you mayb be asked to create a module e.g for a vpc then someone else is given a ticket to also work on the same vpce.g enable login or  the flow logs
it means you both wil clone the same repo , your doing yours he doing yours , when both of you are done , u wil commit he code, depsnding on who commited first the other
person may need to rebase bc now the commit has moved, we stated on the smae commit, w eboth clone frm the main but now bc we hv multiple commit that has come in, it just 
mean that my commit is behind, my main branch has already moved ahead, the commits have moved( am goin tru thsi bc u guys usnderstand hw git work) so it just mean that il
need to rebase my branch before i match my cod e, once i do that w eare colaboarting the that particular repo, now if we are running pipelines, as we run the pipelines the
pipeline wil be bulding our vpc, id changes have happened then those cahnges are goin to be effected, but now the issues comes whne we are running terfrm commands at the same 
time

    *********24:49
 if we are doin in a pipeline then how pipelines hv been set up is pipeline has beeen queued, thers a queue 2piplines will nt run at the same time, once i commit and i do my
push if anoda engr is also pushing at the same time what the pipeline, the CI will do is it will queue the jobs and queing the jobs just means that whover committed the job 
first that pilpline is goin to run, and how it runs is bc am running terfrm, it is goin to put a lock on the state file. this is wher we are talking abt using dynamond DB to 
lock our statefile  and our tstefileis in the s3 bucket, the lock ensuresatha t no other terfrm activity can tk place on that statefile apart from the activity that this 
pipeline is running , so once this psieline is done and the statefile has been updated, it realease the lock and then anoda job can be submeitted
thast what happens terfrm alwsy puts a lock
for us bc we are running it on our local env we hv to configure that lock, we hv to create/configure a dynamond DB thta we will use to lock our ststefile in the s3 bucket
to prevent 2engrs or more running terfrm workflow  on the statefile at the sametime.

********26:28
if u are using terfrm cloud, its done automatically, trfrm cloud wil lock the statefile anytime your doing trfrm workflow so you can only have 1 wrkflow running, after the job 
the lock is is done the lock is taken off , the statefile is unlocked for any other workflow to run

27:00
###### but all this will become clearer when you go furtehr, right now as long a you just understand the basic trffrm concepts, the blocks , the workflow ,jst basic functions
so that you can create a resorce/ data source then that is sufficient, it becomes the building blk for u to build onto that b4 u start thinking of more advanced concept in 
terfrm

QUESTION...........  43:20

i knw that for terfrm, thers cloud formation that works only for aws but for anasible if i want to wrk with windows, is there a particular one ican choose frm chef and puppet

ANS:
thers linux subsistence you can use if you want to wrk with windows 
i probably think chef and puppet only works on windows, am nt very sure but i can find out n let you knw


*********** 52:00   in data "template_cloudinit_config" "user-data" ,   we passed 2scripts
the 2nd script is to configure the vscode  
content      = file("${path.module}/vscode-install.sh")
i did dis automation so that when we start writing playbooks it wil be easier for you guys
this is a script that dose remote development, wherby you need to bc our ansible is on ubuntu, we need to ssh into the ubuntu server then vi into the ubutu server to create
our playbk they run the playbk, so instead of using that we can use our vscode 


                                REMOTE DEVELOPMENT
******52:23
opens the vscode:
if you opens the vscode, and look at the seeting comand pallet thers a remote host, you can connect to a remote host, you can connect to an ec2 instance but b4 you connect 
to that remote host, you need to configure it,you need to configure your ssh so that ... # ### your configuring smt like this:

Host ansible:
   HostName   35.07.199.239                           ******* ie is the ip address of the server that you are  creating 
   User ansible 
   IdentifyFile ~/Downloads/elk-instance.pem               ********** once you pass this inside of your ssh config file then you are able to directly use your vscode code 
                                                       to do remote host, to login to that ec2 instance and write your code, create your files , write your play book 
    and run them on your termiinal, so this is what we call remote development

******* for this to happen we passed the vscode installation script:
 vscode-install.sh
this the script thats goin to install and configure vscode
but apart frm that,we hv this (another) script:script.sh  this is the script that will configure vscode, this is d script that will install vscode and ill show you shortly
hw it works 


  why do we hv 2diff scripts to insatll vscode (script.sh and vscode-install.sh )   ?????

NO.1)                         ####script.sh
   #!/bin/bash

sudo mkdir /home/ansible/.ssh/                                      ***********  it needs to mk a dir in the home of ansible
sudo chown -R ansible:ansible /home/ansible/.ssh                       ********  ansible needs to own that dir
sudo cp /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/ansible/.ssh/          ******* copy the key frm the ubuntu home n copy it in the ansible server
sudo chown ansible:ansible /home/ansible/.ssh/authorized_keys        
sudo chown -R ansible:ansible /etc/ansible                              ********* basically, ansible needs to own that etc/ansible


NO.2)
*******55:51                  i also added 2scripts
            now if your running vscode on linux this is the script that ur goin to use , it is like template, it is goin to use a template to dynamically replace all that

      linux-ssh-script
 cat << EOF >> ~/.ssh/config

Host ${user}
   HostName ${hostname}
   User ${user}
   IdentityFile ${IdentityFile}
EOF

********** and if your running on windows: 

  NO.2ii)         windows-ssh-script.tpl
   
add-content -path c:/users/Ken/.ssh/config -value @'

Host ${user}
   HostName ${hostname}
   User ${user}
   IdentityFile ${IdentityFile}
'@

********* 57:05
NO.3)
*********in our variable file i pased a variable called "os"

  variable "os" {
  type    = string
  #default = "linux"            ****** this is where you need to make your selection
}

this os here, once you select it is using what is called a null resource provisoner 

NO.4)    
***********  Null resource.tf
     we have a local exec provisoner, it selects the script, hv passed a variable so if you choose linux then the template file (NO.2) thats going to run will be linux.ssh
script but if you choose windows, the template script (nO.2ii) that will run wil be windows-ssh-script.tpl
how do you mk your script, your interpreter you hv to select it here, based on your selection, the ? is called itinerery,terrary operator, its what always evaluates the
condition,
so am saying , this  var.os == "windows" ? , is it equals to windows, if this is true then your interpreter will be powershell, then it is goin to run that windows scripts
then if it is nt then your interpreter wil be bash, 
so this ? is called a itenery operator, it always evaluates, its a bullion variable, it always evalustes either true or false
