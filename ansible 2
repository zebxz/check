in the real world 
it wil be a diff scenario that will REQ you to use that basic understaning
e.g they may say we hv a k8 cl8 that is runing in aws we nid to get a the cluster certificate form that cl8 bc we need it somewhere, if given that task so how wil you do it??

ANS: 
so now bc you understand the concept of, if you have a resource that exists you can get inf/attribute frm that resource, so u knw that i can use a data source, i can employ a 
data source that can specifically go into my eks cluster and return for me the certificate, so nmw thats a concept you understand so now you go to the documentation to see if
you have a datasource that acn access your k8 cluster and when it accesses what can it return, how many attributes can it return
again you just look at the documentation, if you use a datasource for eks cluster it will show you the tins that it can return, the inf it can get, so now when you have that 
concept you are goin to employ a data source to get all the inf that you need

but as we go further into the bootcamp everytin will be clearer the concept will solidify , and everything will make more sense
