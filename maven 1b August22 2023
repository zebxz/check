***** we want to do a build so we hv a build server called maven, the build server will clone the codes from scm and do a build, to clone it we run git clone and to do a build 
it will execute mvn package doing the build it is making use of pluggins and dependencies




in the maven server we have the maven local repo
when doing a build maven will search for pluggin and dependencies in maven local repo, if its not there, it will search in maven proxy, if its ot there, it searches in maven
central repo the dependencies could be log4j/Junit/selenium
