APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT   ***tomcat1&2** 
which kind of projects are we managing?
we are managing java based projects - projects that are developed in the java lanaguage
*****mee***  jboss/wildfly supports/used for enterprise application while tomcat supports jar/standalone & war/web applications

 schema appp  **** job application question
How do you approach SOC2 security and compliance within a DevOps framework? *

 
Can you discuss your experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and how you've utilized them in your DevOps practices? *
Aws is our cloud provider and we utilize a lot of Aws resources for the provisioning of our infrastructure which includes creating of instances, Iam for identity and access mgt, S3 bucket for storage, Ebs/Efs for volume/to persist data, Lamba for disaster recovery etc
​
How do you approach SOC2 security and compliance within a DevOps framework? *
Security is inherent in our environment so we uphold the best security practices throughout the end to end deployment process.

                                              KUBERNETES

KUB 1/2 & 3/4.. is all about types of k8 cluster we can install, installing d multi node cluster, creating namespace, how applications are deployed ie usng
pod as a object OR controller managers like RC, RS but we shudnt use pods bc of the short life cycle and inability to scale, also we hv the way we deploy 
workload either using the imperative/command approach or declarative/manifest file approach.
we have then the service discovery ; we have clusterip service & nodeport service.. clusterip is for internal comm within the same ns BUt to est comm from a
diff ns we hee FQDN  while nodeport is for externall comm ie been able to
comm into the cluster from outside , Then to use k8 to pull frm docker/private reg need to create secret login for dockerhub.

KUB 3/4,5,6 & 7, We explored the diff k8 objects used for deployment, kub7 autoscaling, kub 8&9 deploy the legacy appl with nodeport service & mongodb with
clusterip, deploy the mongodb with diff vol without & with pVC,

 HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED ANY ISSUES WORKING WITH TERFRM, WHAT IS USER DATA, TERRAFRM ALSO GIVES US THE OPTION OF BOOTSTRAPPING, INTELLIGIE IDE, 
STEPS FOR CREATING AN INSTANCE/INSTALL HTTPD USING RESOURCE BLK WITH FILE FUNCTION FOR USER DATA(BOOTSTRAPPING) OF THE HTTPD, ANALYZING THE DETAILS OF THE INSTALLATION SCRIPT, 
 TERRAFRM FUNCTIONS, TYPES OF TERRAFRM FUNCTIONS, USING MY IDE & GITBASH  38.25.. tab helps to auto complete, TROUBLESHOOTING WRONG ATTRIBUTE INPUTTED INTO A RESOURCE BLK,

DIFF BTW META ARUMENTS & ARUMENTS/ATTRIBUTES/MODULES, PROVISIONERS/ PROVISIONERS ARE OUR LAST RESORT, TYPES OF PROVISIONERS, LETS SEE HOW REMOTE EXEC WORKS/FILE PROVISIONER;

ILLUSTRATION: this illustration is Basically a compilation of everything we did from video1 to video3 then video4 was just about provisoners 
using local- exec provisioner/inline  TO RUN COMMAND & File provisioner FOR INSTALLATION 
USE DATA SOURCE TO GET AMI FROM A CUSTOM REGION & THE VPC IN THE SMAE REGION, USING A REMOTE STATE DATA SOURCE TO READ THE STATE FILE IN THE LOCAL BACKEND INORDER TO GET 
THE SUBNET ID & INPUT THE ID INTO THE EC2INSTANCE BLK, IN THE INSTANCE BLK WE referenced the KEY VARiable blk A KEY, SECURITY GRP, ELASTIC IP, CREATE A FILE FOR THE KEY; IN
THE NULL RESOURCE WE USE PART.MODULE TO PASS THE PATH TO THE KEY FILE , CREATE A NULL RESOURCE FILE TO CREATE A CONNECTION & USE FILE PROVISIONER TO TRANSFER FILES TO THE 
REMOTE INSTANCE WE CREATED TO INSTALL ELK,KIBANA, METRIC BEAT IN OUR ENV & RUN COMMAND USING REMOTE EXEC. WE ALSO USED LOCAL BACKEND TO STORE THE STATE FILE & MIGRATED THE 
STATE FILE/RESOURCES FROM THE LOCAL BACKEND TO THE REMOTE BACKEND

THE PROVISIONING ILLUSTARTION STEPS,

THE ORDER BY WHICH THE RESOUCES WERE CREATED,  USING PROVISIONERS FOR CONFIGURATION, QUESTION   SSH KEY, USING THE TERRAFORM CONSOLE TO FIRST CONFIRM YOUR CODE, 
USING A LOOP/USING FUNCTIONS, WHAT IS THE part.module, VPC CANT BE DESTROYED WITH RESOURCE INSIDE IT, TROUBLESHOOTING PATH TO FILE, TROUBLESHOOTING SUBNETS, 
NOW WE WNAT TO READ THIS STATEFILE, What is tainting in terfrm, REMOVE WHAT YOU DNT WANT TERFRM TO RECREATE FROM THE CONFIGURATION FILE, NULL RESOURCE  EXPLAINED, 
TROUBLESHOOTING/ ACCESING KIBANA DASHBOARD,  REMOTE BACKEND, S3 BUCKET EXPLAINED, MIGRATE THE EC2instance STATE FILE FROM LOCAL BACKEND TO REMOTE BACKEND, 
MIGRATE THE VPC STATE FILE FROM LOCAL BACKEND TO REMOTE BACKEND & DESTROY THE PREVIOUS VPC OF THE LOCAL BACKEND, HOW CAN I READ A STATEFILE THAT IS IN AN s3 bucket,
HOW TO CREATE AN S3 BUCKET THEN USE IT AS THE REMOTE BACKEND, STATE LOCKING/LOCKING THE STATE FILE,  PULLING STATE FILE,

Core Differences BTW ANSIBLE  & KUBERNETES, HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER, ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION MGT TOOL, ANSIBLE CONCEPTS TO COVER, WHAT IS ANSIBLE, HOW ANSIBLE WORKS, 
OTHER CONFIGURATION MGT TOOLS, BENEFITS OF USING ANSIBLE, USES OF ANSIBLE, ANSIBLE USE SSH PLUGGING TO CONNECT TO LINUX HOST & WINRM FOR HOST ON WINDOWS
INSTALLATION ON UBUNTU & REDHAT, STEPS FOR ANSIBLE INSTALLATION/ PREREQUISITE,  SCRIPT TO BE USED AS AS USER DATA FOR
THE INSTALLATION ON UBUNTU, THE DEFAULT USER IS THE USER I CREATE TO INSTALL ANSIBLE, WE SSH/CONNECT TO THE DEFAULT USER IN THE REMOTE HOST,  IN THE REMOTE NODES THE DEFAULT
USER DOES THE INSTALLATION/PATCH WORK, Script to add user, password and enable password authentication,  WE HAVE TO CREATE THE SAME USER (name) IN THE REMOTE NODE,
TRANSFER KEY TO USER IN THE REMOTE NODE FOR PASSWDLESS AUTHENTICATION, THE AUTOMATION PROCESS USING TERRFORM & SOME HIGH LEVEL BLOCKS/THE USER DATA, 
 SCRIPT FOR THE UBUNTU CONTROLL NODE/PASSING 2 DIFF SCRIPTS AS USER DATA; 1ST SCRIPT TO INSTALL ANSIBLE & USING "template_cloudinit_config" FOR THE 2ND SCRIPT TO INSTALL VSCODE
