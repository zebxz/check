APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT   ***tomcat1&2**
which kind of projects are we managing?
we are managing java based projects - projects that are developed in the java lanaguage
*****mee***  jboss/wildfly supports/used for enterprise application while tomcat supports jar/standalone & war/web applications

 schema appp  **** job application question
How do you approach SOC2 security and compliance within a DevOps framework? *


Can you discuss your experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and how you've utilized them in your DevOps practices? *
Aws is our cloud provider and we utilize a lot of Aws resources for the provisioning of our infrastructure which includes creating of instances, Iam for identity and access mgt, S3 bucket for storage, Ebs/Efs for volume/to persist data, Lamba for disaster recovery etc
​
How do you approach SOC2 security and compliance within a DevOps framework? *
Security is inherent in our environment so we uphold the best security practices throughout the end to end deployment process.

                                              KUBERNETES

KUB 1/2 & 3/4.. is all about types of k8 cluster we can install, installing d multi node cluster, creating namespace, how applications are deployed ie usng
pod as a object OR controller managers like RC, RS but we shudnt use pods bc of the short life cycle and inability to scale, also we hv the way we deploy 
workload either using the imperative/command approach or declarative/manifest file approach.
we have then the service discovery ; we have clusterip service & nodeport service.. clusterip is for internal comm within the same ns BUt to est comm from a
diff ns we hee FQDN  while nodeport is for externall comm ie been able to
comm into the cluster from outside , Then to use k8 to pull frm docker/private reg need to create secret login for dockerhub.

KUB 3/4,5,6 & 7, We explored the diff k8 objects used for deployment, kub7 autoscaling, kub 8&9 deploy the legacy appl with nodeport service & mongodb with
clusterip, deploy the mongodb with diff vol without & with pVC,
