Cloud computing, Cloud Service Models, ADVANTAGES OF USING THE CLOUD 1:55:00
cloud computing is very imp bc COMPANIES ar migrating very quick &fast from on-prem to cloud we'l be looking at hw aws helps us to manage our infrastructure 
 
AWS2
AWS Global Infrastructure, ADVANTAGES OF PLACING MY SERVERS IN DIFF AZS, EXAMPLES OF AWS SERVICES, WHAT TO CONSIDER BEFORE CREATING/HOSTING RESOURCES IN AWS & BEFORE CHOOSING A REGION IN AWS, EC2-Basics, EC2 INSTANCE PUURCHASE OPTION, 
INSTALLING WEBSERVER USING USERDATA ie script, INSTALL WEBSERVER,  INF ABOUT METADATA:  HOW ARE WE CHARGED FOR EC2.  TRANSFERRING FILES OVER THE INTERNET,vPC

AWS3
AWS STORAGE SOLUTION (THE DIFF TYPES PROVIDED ebs/efs/S3), LIST BLOCK COMMAND(root file system) Create/attached & mount ebs, creating my AMI(amazon machine image) =GOLDEN AMIS, CREATING A LIFE CYCLE FOR MY INSTANCE,
CREATE A lifE cycle TO CREATE SNAPSHOTS FOR MY JENKINS INSTANCE, EFS; file storage examples / SHARED Storage, LAMBA FUNCTIONS, DISASTER RECOVERY


AWS4
BROAD CLASSIFICATION OF AWS RESOURCES, s3 buckets/STEPS TO CREATE S3 BUCKET, IMPORTANT TO TAKE NOTE OF IN S3; Permissions/POLICIES,
AWS ACCOUNT:Global resources



AWS5 
VPC, SUBNET/ CIDR BLOCK/ ADDRESSES, S3 BUCKET CANT BE CREATED IN SUBNET, ROUTE TABLES, NAT GATEWAY, NACL, LAUNCH JUMPSERVER, LAUNCH DBSERVER, 
LAUNCH WEBSERVER(install ngnix) 


AWS6
HOW TO ESTABLISH VPC PEERING, MODIFY THE ROUTE TABLE SUCH THAT DER CAN B A PRIVate ntwrk established, SANDBOX/ FRM THE JUMPBOX EST PARING CONNECTION ie
FOR THE SANDBOX WITH/VIA THE JUMPSERVER


AWS7&8                        *****HOW TO  AUTO SCALING GRP & ALB, was treated in AWS9, i think NLB was treated in video 7/8 & 8
Elastic Load Balancers& AUTO SCALLING GRP,  LISTENER, (NLB)NETWRK LOAD BALANCER*** Meee (LAYER 4 support), DIFF BETWEEN NLB & ALB,
(ALB)APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER, GATEWAY LOADBANCE, USERDATA to install tomcat & docker for the APPSERVERS TO ACCESS THE APPLICATION VIA THE LB


8B                                *****  i think NLB was treated in video 7/8 & 8 WHILE ALB was in video 9
WHAT DETERMINES HOW TRAFFIC ARE ROUTED AND WHEN SHUD TRAFFIC BE ROUTED, CREATING LOAD BALANCER;(HEALTH CHECK, LISTERNER/ TARGET GROUP)
CREATE MAVEN & TOMCAT SERVERS FOR DEPLOYMENT, HOW THE LB WILL BE ROUTING TRAFFIC TO THE BACKEND APPLICATION  ie the servers, USERS ACCESS OUR BACKEND
APPLICATION, DNS RECORDS, CREATING DOMIAN  NAME, BENEFITS OF LB


AWS9
CREATE REOCORDSET/HOSTED NAME USING DNS, TO ACCESS THE APPLICATION, CREATING APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER, CREATING ALB,HOW TO ACCESS OUR MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS 
 CREATE A RECORDS & DEFINE RULES, HOW TO ENCRYPT DATA, REQ CERT FRM AWS/TO VALIDATE THE CERT, SSL REDIRECT, STICKY SESSIONS, CONFIGURING SESSION TIME, 
HW CAN WE AUTO SCALE TO ACHIEVE FULL AUTOMATION, TO MK A SERVER HIGHLY AVAILABLE, CREATING A LAUNCH TEMPLATE FROM THE SCRATCH WITHOUT AN AMI, 
SECURITY OF VPC/ROUTE TABLE ACTS AS A SECURITY MEASURE 



DOCKER1 &2
 OPTIONS TO USE FOR DEPLYMENT, DIFF BTW VIRTUALIZED DEPLOYMENT & TRADITIONAL, CONTAINERS, VIRTUAL MACHINES vs CONTAINER, APPL RUN AS CONTAINERS,CONTAINERS HAVE ALL THE REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES,  DOCKER, ADVANTAGES OF DOCKER,
CONTAINERIZATION SOFTWARE RUNTIME,  INSTALL DOCKER ,CONTAINERIZE APPLICATION, DOCKER FILE, DOCKER IMAGE, STEPS FOR CONTAINERIZATION, BUILD IMAGE, INSTALL MAVEN, DOCKER RUN(CREATE CONTAINERS/DEPLOY),
2 CONTAINERS FROM THE SAME IMAGE CANT HV THE SAME HOST PORT NUMBER& NAME BT CAN HV THE SAME CONTAINER NAME, CAN I DEPLOY A CONTAINER FRM AN IMAGE I DID NOT CREATE, ACCESS MY APPLICATION, DOCKER REGISTRY,  DOCKERHUB.io,  
CREATE & SHARE DOCKER IMAGE, DOCKER ARCHITECTURE,  RUN CONTAINER WITH PULLED IMAGE,
