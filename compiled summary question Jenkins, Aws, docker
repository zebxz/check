interview question   .. : EXPLAIN YOUR JENKINS PIPELINE 
 THere were 2 explanations 


JEN 1&2
IQ: Explain you EXPERIENCE in applying Jenkins?? 
Ticket001:
JEN4&5
in landmak technology i work in a team where we 
1) develop, test, build, secure, deploy manage & monitor web&enterprise applications for fintech clients like .
****MEEEE*** I bliv this is where we explain the jenkins integration with all the other tools/software/ Create a Jenkins job for the project


 TYPES OF JENKINS PROJECTS:
FREE Style project            when u use maven to do a build under free style project, u take more time &nid to do a lot of configurations(we ar always clicking on configure
software builds            so instaed of using freestyle we can use maven projects. to ensure d time used to configure d project is kept to the barest minimum, we use maven project
application deployent
server monitoring/application performance monitoring=APM

******we can also build using graddle



What is Jenkins automating ?
  
How do you use Jenkins for CI/CD automation ?
In Landmark, we manage federated JAVA based web & enterprise applications
(web.ear) for Fintech Clients/ DOD/ E-commerce.
We also manage a few python, NodeJs and .net web applications

FinTech = Financial Technology : 

Financial Technology can perform the following;
1. payment Gateways   
2. account creation 
3. credit management 
2. etc. 


FinTech = Financial Technology can be use by any company.  
POS Machine =   
  Banks     = TD / RBC / BOA / CHASE / Barclays / UBA / Ecobank / BICEC
  Insurance = STATEFARM, belair, Alstate/BeneficialLife 

  Payment Gateways = paypal, visa, master, interac, 
                     pushpay, cashapp, zelle, mobileMoney  

  E-commerce = amazon, ebay, alibaba, jumia, facebook MarketPlace / Telecoms  = MTN, Vadofone, Glo, verizon, tmobile, at&t/  Health care = NIS, NIH, 

  Retail = Walmart, cotsco, tesco, /  Airlines = AA, UA, BA, KLM, AC, westJet, emirates, airpeace, camairco/ sports = FIFA, UEFA, CAF, FECAFOOT, NBA, UFC, ETC./  Governments = DOD, IRS, CRA, FIRS , 
  
  betting = LOTTO, 1XBET, / Oil & Gas = shell, total, BP, NNPC /Crypto = coinbase, FTX, bitcoin/ over 95% of companies uses FinTech today =
  
  Taxi =  uber, Lyft, yango, bolt, swift /Food chain = pizza, ubereats, doordash, / IT Companies = AWS, AZURE, GCP, Landmarktech /auto = Tesla, Toyota, Mercedes, BMW, Honda, GMC, 




Explain your experience as a DevOps Engineer?
I have over 6 years experience managing FinTech clients. 95%

1/2/3/4/5 =    

What is the difference b/w github and nexus??       They are both softwares 
  - infrastructure difference 
      - GITHUB is a SaaS tool ---  server Installation NOT required    
      - Nexus is an IaaS tool ---  server Installation required        
  - use cases:
      - GITHUB IS A SCM  
      - Nexus is an Artifactory Repository 

  - Vendor:
      - GITHUB = Microsoft 
      - Nexus  = Sonatype Nexus    




xplain your EXPERIENCE in open source Technologies?? :
  Linux OS, maven, tomcat, sonarQube, Nexus, Nginx, Git, GitHub  


*********** Saas ( software as a service) doesnt take much time like Iaas which requires server installation


What is the difference b/w Sonarqube and SonarCloud??   
  - infrastructure difference 
      - SonarCloud is a SaaS tool ---  server Installation NOT required    
      - Sonarqube is an IaaS tool ---  server Installation required   



Explain your experience in SaaS solutions? 
   = Github, SonarCloud, 



IQ: Explain you EXPERIENCE in applying Jenkins?? 
Ticket001:
Install Jenkins in redhat9 server (ec2 instance in aws)


IQ = Have you managed Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment projects??
YES:
 Internal projects: In house  --> Continuous Deployment, this is automated
 External projects: Clients  ---> Continuous Delivery,  ther a gateway where the cx will need to accept that it is waht they want before it is deployed



Nature of application:
  We support critical applications for a FinTech/e-commerce CLIENTS 

DevOps/JENKINS is all about automation   

7Cs:  to take note of
   CD,t---> Continuous Development [Git/GitHub/IDEs /GitBranch/gitTag
   
   CI --> Continuous Integration [Git/GitHub/Jenkins/maven/sonarqube/nexus] 
              [Build and Release Engineering]
   
   CD --> Continuous Delivery [build=packages/artifacts-->testing/UAT--manualApproval--- prod]   but wahen it goes to auto from UAT/testing = continous deployment
   
   CD --> Continuous Deployment [build=packages/artifacts-->testing/UAT--auto--- prod]
   
   CM --> Continuous Monitoring
            https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/powerwall  
            https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/modelx
 
   CS --> Continuous security
   CT --> Continuous Testing 




JENKIN3
Automate builds using build triggers.

JEN4&5 (B)

JENKINS EXECUTORS ARE NOT PLUGINS, THEY ARE agents and parameters in jenkins that permit us to run jobs in the slave servers
we use plugins to establish connection btw jenkins and the slaves , for the slave to be added to the jenkins master, we need to use the ssh agent plugin

extends the functionality of jenkins, maven, etc.   
JACOCO 5, • SSH Agent 6, Email Extension 7 ,• SonarQube Scanner 8, • Audit Trail Plugin 9, . job import plugin  10, • Schedule Build 11, • Artifactory Plugin, • Cloud Foundry


Explain how you have applied Jenkins and resolve build failures?? 

PROJECTS: 
  In LandmakTechnology I work in a Team where we:
1. Develop, test, build, secure, deploy, manage & monitor web and 
   enterprise applications for FinTech clients like;
      Banks  [ boa, wf, barclays, rbc, td, bicec, uba, ecobank ] 
      Insurance [BLI, WFG, TD, Sunlife, AIG  ] 
      Money Transfer [zelle, cashApp, interact, MTN-MOMO,
      payment gateways = VISA, MASTERCard, Paypal 

2. We automate the entire process stated above:by intergrating all the tools we hv been able to discuss
   PROJECTS Requirements:
    Git [git-bash]:
        IDEs = Integrated Development Environment simplifies the deployment process  
        vscode, pycharm, eclipes, atom 


IQ: Explain your experience using Jenkins in your Environment??? 
answers:
 1. I and my team have used Jenkins to automate tasks and run jobs/workloads:uing,
   ---  freestyle projects --- 5mins
   ---- maven projects     --- 2mins  
   ---- Pipeline projects  
   ---- multi-branch pipeline 
 2. With Jenkins i have managed projects such as:
    --- software/application builds and testing and deployment  
    --- systems  monitoring  
    --- application monitoring  
    --- database backup
    --- Infrastructure provisioning - when jenkins/terraform are integrated.. jenkins/terraformintegration 
    --- Infrastructure Configuration mgt - jenkins/ansible integration 
 3. I have installed, removed and updated plugins that extend Jenkins functionality:
   installed deploy to container
   update deploy to container 
   remove deploy to container
   Read The Release Notes [Documentation] for the Plugins 
   most Jenkins Plugins are developed by the Community  

 4. Using Jenkins Plugins to achieve automation:such as ,
  ssh, sshAgent, Publish-over-SSH, deploy to container, Slack notification,   
  job import, jacoco,
aside frm installing plugins, i hv also used plugins to achieve atomation and hv taken automation to the nxt level by 
configuring build triggers
 5. Configuring Build triggers such as:[pollSCM, webhooks] for automation:
i hv secured jenkins by ensuring :
 6. Configuring credentials for authentications:
     GitHub credentials 
     Tomcat-user 
     Docker-hub/Nexus/SonarQube/SONARCLOUD 
     username/temporal access /  

  7. Configuring Jenkins (master)slave agents  using ssh plugins:


8. Troubleshooting jenkins build related problems:
     -- permissions issues, Unauthorized [4** error codes] , i manage the credentials such taht jenkins can be authenicated by github or nexus accordingly
                     e.g jenkins trying to connect with nexus/sonarqube/github

     -- Jenkins [GitHub/sonarqube/nexus/tomcat] 

     -- Jenkins agent/slave failing to connect to the master
        [java not install], wrong java version, AUTHENTICATION

 9. Installation and configuration of the Jenkins server in Linux/Windows systems:  

 10. Securing the Jenkins server  :
   

IQ: What problems have you faced using/applying Jenkins in your Environment??
     1. builds failing
     2. jenkins service failing start so we need the complier, check if [java-11-openjdk] is installed
     3. slave/agent failing to connect to the master [bc of executables] mayb java is nt installed or trying to run multiple jobs at once
jenkins master slave architecture
to run multiple jobs at once,  we may have one jenkins master server connecting to to other jenkins slaves via executioners
      4. integration isues, integration failing
     3. firewall issues = ports [8080 / 8899] not open      


QUESTIONS:
why do DEvelopers need git in their environment since git will be installed in jenkins?
developers are to develp the application and use git for versioning the application, 
when they do a git commit, they creat a new version
and to share the code they need the git push command and as a devops engr, we need git to clone the code.
we no longer need maven standalone bc in jenkins we can install maven as a tool
if we want to run a job in jenkins we can jenkins master slave architeture without havin to install maven in the set slave server, so long as i hv 
the tool maven installed and running in jenkins and with the help of jenkins executors, jenkins will run the jobs with relative ease.

is the low system/resource requirement/capacity of agent that were established a problem?.. e.g some are free tier servers
bc our jenkins reqire a minimum of 4GB ram 
not necessary, as a matter of fact , this is the first time an agent has failed on the grouns that it doesnt hv enough resources, but thi scan abe added as one of the problems
encountered for TS using jenkins and hw did you solve them 

ADVANTQAGES OF SLAVE MASTER ARCHITECTURE
it helps in redundancy e.g if the job in the master fails, we stil hv the jobs in the slaves
it enhances the master performance
it helps with para builds,i.e running multiple jobs at once, inorder words, one job doesnt hv to run and end b4 another starts.. bc under normal circumstances, 
when running multiple jobs in jenkins, depending on the number of executioners,one j
