                  Aws assignment videos, i must watch aws7/8, 8b; start from 1.54.00 & the whole 0f 9 & 10/11
MY QUESTION
In AWS 6, we did a private connection with vpc peering,
we ssh into our sandbox from the jumpserver, and that was how the video for the class ended 
was that just to show us how to est a private connection OR in the real world can the sandbox serve as our 
app/db server where we can install like tomcat software for deployment?

in landmak technology i work in a team where we 
1) develop, test, build, secure, deploy manage & monitor web&enterprise applications for fintech clients like .
****MEEEE*** I bliv this is where we explain the jenkins integration with all the other tools/software/ Create a Jenkins job for the project


 TYPES OF JENKINS PROJECTS:
FREE Style project            when u use maven to do a build under free style project, u take more time &nid to do a lot of configurations(we ar always clicking on configure
software builds            so instaed of using freestyle we can use maven projects. to ensure d time used to configure d project is kept to the barest minimum, we use maven project
application deployent
server monitoring/application performance monitoring=APM

******we can also build using graddle



What is Jenkins automating ?
  
How do you use Jenkins for CI/CD automation ?
In Landmark, we manage federated JAVA based web & enterprise applications

JENKIN3
Automate builds using build triggers.

JEN4&5 (B)

JENKINS EXECUTORS ARE NOT PLUGINS, THEY ARE agents and parameters in jenkins that permit us to run jobs in the slave servers
we use plugins to establish connection btw jenkins and the slaves , for the slave to be added to the jenkins master, we need to use the ssh agent plugin

extends the functionality of jenkins, maven, etc.   
JACOCO 5, • SSH Agent 6, Email Extension 7 ,• SonarQube Scanner 8, • Audit Trail Plugin 9, . job import plugin  10, • Schedule Build 11, • Artifactory Plugin, • Cloud Foundry


Explain how you have applied Jenkins and resolve build failures?? 

PROJECTS: 
  In LandmakTechnology I work in a Team where we:
1. Develop, test, build, secure, deploy, manage & monitor web and 
   enterprise applications for FinTech clients like;
      Banks  [ boa, wf, barclays, rbc, td, bicec, uba, ecobank ] 
      Insurance [BLI, WFG, TD, Sunlife, AIG  ] 
      Money Transfer [zelle, cashApp, interact, MTN-MOMO,
      payment gateways = VISA, MASTERCard, Paypal 

2. We automate the entire process stated above:by intergrating all the tools we hv been able to discuss
   PROJECTS Requirements:
    Git [git-bash]:
        IDEs = Integrated Development Environment simplifies the deployment process  
        vscode, pycharm, eclipes, atom 


IQ: Explain your experience using Jenkins in your Environment??? 
answers:
 1. I and my team have used Jenkins to automate tasks and run jobs/workloads:uing,
   ---  freestyle projects --- 5mins
   ---- maven projects     --- 2mins  
   ---- Pipeline projects  
   ---- multi-branch pipeline 
 2. With Jenkins i have managed projects such as:
    --- software/application builds and testing and deployment  
    --- systems  monitoring  
    --- application monitoring  
    --- database backup
    --- Infrastructure provisioning - when jenkins/terraform are integrated.. jenkins/terraformintegration 
    --- Infrastructure Configuration mgt - jenkins/ansible integration 
 3. I have installed, removed and updated plugins that extend Jenkins functionality:
   installed deploy to container
   update deploy to container 
   remove deploy to container
   Read The Release Notes [Documentation] for the Plugins 
   most Jenkins Plugins are developed by the Community  

 4. Using Jenkins Plugins to achieve automation:such as ,
  ssh, sshAgent, Publish-over-SSH, deploy to container, Slack notification,   
  job import, jacoco,
aside frm installing plugins, i hv also used plugins to achieve atomation and hv taken automation to the nxt level by 
configuring build triggers
 5. Configuring Build triggers such as:[pollSCM, webhooks] for automation:
i hv secured jenkins by ensuring :
 6. Configuring credentials for authentications:
     GitHub credentials 
     Tomcat-user 
     Docker-hub/Nexus/SonarQube/SONARCLOUD 
     username/temporal access /  

  7. Configuring Jenkins (master)slave agents  using ssh plugins:


8. Troubleshooting jenkins build related problems:
     -- permissions issues, Unauthorized [4** error codes] , i manage the credentials such taht jenkins can be authenicated by github or nexus accordingly
                     e.g jenkins trying to connect with nexus/sonarqube/github

     -- Jenkins [GitHub/sonarqube/nexus/tomcat] 

     -- Jenkins agent/slave failing to connect to the master
        [java not install], wrong java version, AUTHENTICATION

 9. Installation and configuration of the Jenkins server in Linux/Windows systems:  

 10. Securing the Jenkins server  :
   

IQ: What problems have you faced using/applying Jenkins in your Environment??
     1. builds failing
     2. jenkins service failing start so we need the complier, check if [java-11-openjdk] is installed
     3. slave/agent failing to connect to the master [bc of executables] mayb java is nt installed or trying to run multiple jobs at once
jenkins master slave architecture
to run multiple jobs at once,  we may have one jenkins master server connecting to to other jenkins slaves via executioners
      4. integration isues, integration failing
     3. firewall issues = ports [8080 / 8899] not open      


QUESTIONS:
why do DEvelopers need git in their environment since git will be installed in jenkins?
developers are to develp the application and use git for versioning the application, 
when they do a git commit, they creat a new version
and to share the code they need the git push command and as a devops engr, we need git to clone the code.
we no longer need maven standalone bc in jenkins we can install maven as a tool
if we want to run a job in jenkins we can jenkins master slave architeture without havin to install maven in the set slave server, so long as i hv 
the tool maven installed and running in jenkins and with the help of jenkins executors, jenkins will run the jobs with relative ease.

is the low system/resource requirement/capacity of agent that were established a problem?.. e.g some are free tier servers
bc our jenkins reqire a minimum of 4GB ram 
not necessary, as a matter of fact , this is the first time an agent has failed on the grouns that it doesnt hv enough resources, but thi scan abe added as one of the problems
encountered for TS using jenkins and hw did you solve them 

ADVANTQAGES OF SLAVE MASTER ARCHITECTURE
it helps in redundancy e.g if the job in the master fails, we stil hv the jobs in the slaves
it enhances the master performance
it helps with para builds,i.e running multiple jobs at once, inorder words, one job doesnt hv to run and end b4 another starts.. bc under normal circumstances, 
when running multiple jobs in jenkins, depending on the number of executioners,one j

      QUESTION
whats the key implicTION FOR WEBSECURITY AND USER PRIVACY When a website Exclusively uses port 443 for all its traffic compared to a website that uses port 80 bc we are that port 80 wil hv some unencrypted traffics but if we are
dealing with sensitive mayb data base  &user inf is it adviceable to open port 80

ANS ; thats a very question and we will be looking at all those stuffs when it comes to ntwrk security as well as we progress with the programm  
  but let me just state what makes http & http diff  (as seen above )



39.00  EARLIER YOU SAID WE CAN LAUNCH A SERVER WITHOUT ANIP ADDRRESS, THAT the ip address only helps us to cnnect only to the internet, so if we can launch a server without an ip address, what are we goin to do with it, apart from the
work that e do tru the internet also can we change a zone after a server is already running?? 

ANS:You cant change the zone of ur server, once you choose it, its a permanent decision
*40.11 if u launch a server in us east one A , it cant be moved to us east b bc the computer is hosted in us east A,, thats where the hardware is found. cos once u host a server 
you are creating a virtual machine, u hv launced a virtual computer bt they ar running on a physical hardware system which ar located in a specific location
 and those locations ar in data centers,or availability zones, so we can uae data centers  and avail zone to an extent  interghangeable 
you can only choose the aws zone while the instance is being made, bc once a server is hosted u are creating a virtual computer

****35.00 we wil see the diff classif of aws RES
we hv resources that ar availa zone specific ..ie their scope is within an availa zone 
we also hv resources that their scope is regional and aws services  that their scope is global
we are going to be loking at that


###41:00 the public ip address is optional i.e u can allow ur server be allocated an ip address or nt bt regardless, th eprivate ip adress must be assigned to servers
when u stop the server the pulic ip address is released back to aws and the server is assigned a new pub ip but when we start worjing in coy, we wont hv to stop the server 
bc the uptime of the server is important ie hw long the server has been running 

43.05******you can only use your private ip to connect to your servers when your servers are in the same netwrk

**** When we stop a server the private-IP/DNS address cannot changed at restart 
When we stop a server the public-IP address will changed at restart ,,bc the ip address is released once we stop the server
  use an elasticIP to maintain a static public-IP even after restart

IQ: Explain your experience with AWS Storage services ?
 what ar the diff storage solution u hv been exposed to as a devops engr
hv been exposed to block storages like ebs volume,v been exposed to file storage like elastic file system, netwrk file sys,google drive etc also object storage like s3bucket


IQ:    Explain a project you did which you are proud of  ? 
we can also  write a lamba function , lamba function has what is called diasaster recover
if u work for landmark and we hv aws account1, & aws account2. in account1 we hv a database servers running ,  for account 2 (diaster recovery account, for our database servers backup)
because diaster can occur , eg if someelse is able to access d email&paswd & log into aws wit root access, thers a possiblity of a disaster bc dats a serious issue bc they wil hv 
access to all my servers bt wit account 1 & account 2, our disaster recovery is accont 2, wit our database serververs running in account 1, we back the databases in accout2
by creating a snapshot lifecycle policy using Lambda  which
create sonapshots, wich is a replica of account1 from our databases from account1 in account2 cross region , so we ar able to recover frm account2

1.58.00   So what we do is We created a snapshot lifecycle policy using Lambda  which
creates sonapshots from our databases from account1 in account2
snapshot is a replica of your database, its a backup
therefore if account1 is hacked, we already hv everything in account2 so we are able to recover from account2 
SO WIT THE HELP OF LAMBDA & snapshot lifecycle policy, this entire process was automated
so am proud of this project

FOR SECURITY CONNECTING TO THE APP/DB SERVERS VIA THE JUMPSRVER
 security is inherent in our environment , WE DNT ALLOW DIRECT acces in our db server, if u wnt to acces it u v to go tru our 
jump sevrer. traffic goes to the jummpsever bc it has a security grp dat is permitting the trafic, it allows trafic on port22 so  in d
 SG 22 is open for members of the team & my vpc 10.0.0.0/24,i.e my ip. so my ip & port22 ar d two access  
2:02:13 . security grp in frnt of the db server is only local so u can only access db server via the jumpsevr, the jumpserver acts as 
the entry point when it comes to ssh access,  frm d jump server u can access the app/ db servers,so any server in the vpc can be accessed
via the jump server.
QUESTION
does d seceurity grp in my db sever permit trafic frm the jumpserver. if am outside the ntwrk of the vpc,to access
the jumpsever i nid the publicip of the jumpserver.
2;05:00 to access my jumpserver,ssh jumpservr in mobaxterm.
2:11:50 we can also aces the jumpserver wit the private ip if we are inside the vpc,e.g i can ssh to the jumpsevre frm my app server if my firewall permits it&dat is local 
access, bc they ar all resources witin my vpc

cos once we get into kubernetes, its going to be abt routing traffic to multiple backend application ... . 


********* take note of the differnce btw NLB & ALB
23:37 ... 1)THERS ALSO NTWRK LOAD BALANCER /    *** Meee (LAYER 4 support)
it deals with source and destination, &when it comes to d target grp dey ar created using TCp id or protocol & a trget grp can v up..
to 1000 targets and we will do all the config ..tcp= source &destination..video 8a (1:11.. d protocol here that it suport, the listener is tcp got to do wit source& destinatn 
this falls under layer4support..... ntwrk lb is faster than ALB BC NTwrk is source to destination bt for ALB when it receives a trafic it has to filters the tarfic to knw the
the right target to route the trafic to .... also it has multiple target grps wjile ntwrk has one target grp... ntwrk LB ia faster bc its routed on layer4 of the osi model &
its the transport layer dedicated for transport so by default for transmissn data layer4 is super fast
layer7 the application layer, route trafic base on content of the trafic.


 
can we pair across 2platforms ??? 
VIDEO 7 .8:33 if u hv resources in gcp and aws & lets assume you wan to pair from AWS, therefore AWS can be your cloud & you can consider gcp as an onprem resource like any other onprem resource bc they are not 
in the same cloud provider platform, so its like an onprem resource
***student bt you said we cannot pair frm aws and onprem server
e.g aws can be our and gcp can be an on premp resource
..... you are going to be using diff options like vpm , aws direct and etc

AWS9
 CAN WE USE ONE NLB FOR MULTIPLE APPLICATION ? ... NO
NLB goes with tcp protocol and its layer4 support also it  has one/single target grp


MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK someone was asked in an interview... the protocol we use to access information is very  imp
1:19:12 when tryig to route traffic, in the browseer, it says ur connection to this site is nt secure...  we ere using http protocol
he typed td.com and we could see the lock bc it is https ich is secured
1:20:4 when e type https, it gives us option for what is called ssl, secured layer, or tls ,ssl& tls termination 
for secured protcol, port 443 is used for https, cop dnt use http to transmit their content bc its nt secured n ALB supports ssl & tls termination.
data/inf from endusers wil go tru encryption process, it wil b encrypted or coded


Explain your experience with SSL/TLS certificate  



??????#### some said he was askeD in the interview hw he (d interviewer) gave e.g of xray hw do ur private subnet to d outside , hw do u configure that& he told him vpn bt
at the end he asked the interviwer what he wud do and he told him endpoint 
*** prof wil xplain hw to use vpn endpoint and relational endpoint e.g when a database is crsated ina  private subnt and u wnt ot access it in a dif envir like a kubenetes
cluster then u nid the endpoint of the database

????if i create an account in a server n der are many servers and nxt time am in another server, is der a way to replicate all the data that is on the first server to this 
present server, ie concerning LB.... prof yes ders a replication process , once an application ar captured,once u access an applica u v d option to write data into the
application n ders  genearallyy a data base stuff we look at once we get into docker , hw to use databases n mk our life a little more easy.
