deployment as an object

Deployments  
==========
Deployment is a kubernetes object. 
k8 objects are used to run workloads in k8
Deployment is the recommended kubernetes object for deploying applications,  
running workloads and managing/contolling pods in our environment.   

Advantages:
     Deploy/rollout a RS.
     Updates pods (PodTemplateSpec).
     Rollback to older Deployment versions.
     Scale Deployment up or down.
     Pause and resume the Deployment.
     Use the status of the Deployment to determine state of replicas.
     Clean up older RS that you donâ€™t need anymore.

e.g we create a deployment called webapp and say that replica is 2
with deployment as an object :2 rplicas of the appl wil b deployed &2pods for d webapp  &when an update is done ie verson2, the update is deployed wit a new set of 2replicas
and new pods but the previous replicas will be zero (0) and 0 pods but the webapp versions still exists, this is the same process for each version that is rolled out and so
we can easily delelete or roll back to a previous set bc their replica sets were recorded
---
#### i can use IDES to generate a file and just copy then jst use what i nid v... integrated development env
*****strategy can be rolling update or recreate... 
rolling update is the default startegy  so if u dnt enter a strategy, it wil be uisng rolling update
also if w dnt define replica only 1 replica will be created

---==----------------------we are nt passing strategy bc we want the default strategy to be sused and we didnt nt define replica too

**************kubectl apply -f deploy/ ...... to deploy the file

what is the default deployment strategy?
  RollingUpdates  

kubectl scale deployment <deploymentName> --replicas <noOfReplicas>
kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas 2    

Deployment strategies:
======================
ReCreate strategy  --- 
  It comes with downtime because the current application version is destroy entirely
  before creating the new version  

   8 pods of version1 running 
   deploy 8 pods of version2 
-------------------

# Create Deployment
kubectl apply -f deploy/app.yml  

# Verify Deployment
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get deploy 

# Describe Deployment
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
kubectl describe deploy deploymentname    

# Verify ReplicaSet
kubectl get rs

# Verify Pod
kubectl get po

Scaling a Deployment
====================
# Scale Up the Deployment
kubectl scale --replicas=20 deployment/<Deployment-Name>
kubectl scale --replicas=20 deployment/myapp 

# Verify Deployment
kubectl get deploy

# Verify ReplicaSet
kubectl get rs

# Verify Pods
kubectl get po

# Scale Down the Deployment
kubectl scale --replicas=2 deployment/myapp  
kubectl get deploy

Expose Deployment as a Service
==============================

apiVersion: v1

  name: appsvc
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80

RollingUpdates strategy:   no downtime 
-# Deployment RollingUpdate

  name: web
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello

    spec:
      containers:

        image: mylandmarktech/hello:1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

Update Deployments
Introduction
    We can update deployments using two options
        Set Image
        Edit Deployment

# Update Deployment - SHOULD WORK NOW
kubectl set image deploy Deployment-Name> <Container-Name>=<Container-Image> --record=true
kubectl set image deploy web helloworld=mylandmarktech/hello:2 --record=true

Rollback to previous version
============================
# Undo Deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/web  

# List Deployment Rollout History
kubectl rollout history deployment/web    

Blue Green deployment Technique : 
   version1/blue running in production
   version2/green deployed in production  
   we deploy version2 in the test environment and observe its performance 
   Once the performance is good then we deploy version2/green in production          

Canary deployment Technique : 
   - TRAFFIC MGT   
   - 25% traffic VERSION2 goes to Canada  
   - 75% traffic VERSION1 goes to USA  
   - VERSION1 -- 40% to version1   
   - VERSION2 -- 60% to version2           
   - 40years+   75% traffic VERSION1
   - 18-39years 25% traffic VERSION2
