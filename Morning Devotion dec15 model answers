2. Describe the project you are currently managing = 3mins  
   a. AMAZON eks custer using terraform/console/CLI  
       -  other AWS services/resources  
       -  VPC and its components
       -  EC2 instances / Serverless Farget / ebs / efs / RDS/S3 
       -  asg / LT / LC / ELB / 
       -  IAM   
       -  terraform init/validate/fmt/plan/apply/destroy/import
                    output/kubeconfig   
                    terraformstate.tf  

   b. I provision and manage resources using the console & CLI   
      & most importantly IaC with terraform/
      - I write and modify terraform modules/scripts 
      - i make use modules & variables to create reusable codes
      - I also manage the terraform workflow in my environment  
        terraform init/validate/fmt/plan/apply/destroy/import/refresh   
      - with same terraform script i provision resources in dev/test/prod

  demovpc: 10.0.0.0/16   -- IaC  
    sn1:   10.0.0.0/24   -- IaC
    sn2:   10.0.1.0/24   -- IaC 
    sn3:   10.0.2.0/24   -- created from the console  
    demoServer  = t2.micro  - -- IaC  
    demoServer is changed from t2.micro to t2.xlarge - -- console  
    terraform refresh  
  verify: cat terraformstate / terraform show  / console  
 
 c. migrating/importing fully to IaC with terraform  

 d.- containerisation of applications using docker   
      - I'm task to install docker and kubernetes in ubuntu servers 
      - I containerised applications by:
         - writing and modifying dockerfiles using best practices
         - use ONLY Official images for base images   
         - Reduce the number of RUN keyword to create light weight images 
           because it add layers to your image and the final image size. 
         - use executable form over shell form for CMD,ENTRYPOINT
           & RUN Instructions for the application process to run as parent 
         - Use alpine images as much as possible   
         - scan images before use  
         - .dockerignore file. 
      - creating and sharing images in registry - dockerhub/nexus

  e: orchestrating/managing containerised applications using kubernetes
     - container mgt using kubernetes 
     - writing and modifying kubernetes manifest files  
     - managing the kubernetes Infrastructure/architecture
        controlPlane workernodes  
     - Setting-up a multi-nodes self Managed k8s using kubeadm, kops
       Setting-up a multi-nodes  Managed k8s using eks
     - application mgt:
        1. deploying stateless applications using controllerMgers
        deployment, RS, CM, Secrets /      
        2. deploying stateful applications using controllerMgers
           statefulsets, RS, CM, Secrets, PV, PVC, SC, /  
        3. deploying monitoring applications like Prometheus/Grafana, EFK
           DS, RS, deployments,CM, Secrets, PV, PVC, SC, / 
        4. using helm package to deploy+mgt applications     
     -  5. exposing applications to endUsers using serviceDiscovery
           ClusterIP, NodePort, LB, ExternalName , ingress  / 
           NetworkPolicy
  f. Troubleshooting kubernetes related problems
     - Node = failed nodes /CPU/mem/ OOM Killed / 
     - pod  = pods pending / slow starting pod / wrong image/imageTag
     -        short lifecycle / not a controllerMger
     - manifest problem:
        POD labels not matching controllerMgers selectors  
        POD labels not matching service selectors
           - writing jenkins pipelines scripts for ci/cd automation  
        syntax issues   
        
   - managing and granting access into aws services  
   - deploying aws services using terraform   
   - migrating monolithic to microservices architecture
   - Setting up a kubernetes cluster using KOPS
   - managing artifacts using nexus  
   - writing and modifying ansible playbooks & roles for 
     fileMGT/userMGT/packageMGT/deploymentMGT/securityMGT
   - writing and modifying dockerfile, docker-compose files
     creating and sharing docker images using best pactices  
   - writing and modifying Jenkinsfiles and Jenkins shares libraries
   - deploying APM tools like NeWRelic, Prometheus/Grafana using helm
   - preparing detail documentations 
   - morning devotion
