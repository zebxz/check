                            DEPLOYMENT AND EXPOSING THE APPL
1:32:32
i ubderstand what u guys are saying some points are nt clear , in ibe explanation
ibe was trying to explain am manaaging appll deployment the way the appl is made available to client such that its in the 3tier acrchitecture but there are 2 things
deploying appl is one, exposing those appl to end users is 2
how do you deploy your appl thats number 1, thats the first part of the deal/bargain
such that in an interview if u are deploying appl in tomcat servers and ur informing that on my pipeline am using ansible to automate the deployment, so we hv abt 7tomcat
servers, hv written playbooks all the tomcat servers are part of our host inventory in ansible and by the time we run our playbk the appl is automatically deployed by 
tomcat to all the app servers , now that is deploying the appl
AFTer the deployment endusers need to access the appl,in our env our appl are runing in the appservers, our env is heavy on security so security is inherent , we expose our
 appl by placing a webserver in front of our app servers therfrore endusers traffic only talk to our webserver and the webserver since we are using ngnix ingress, we hv been
able to create ngress rules that route traffic to the backend appservers 

so thers how u will present your facts and thats my main focus 


*********** 1:38:35
whats the diff btw netwrk lb and appl load balancer  and whats the diff btw ssl certificate and  tsl certificate

ANS: 
ill add this to our list of questions to address
when ur tryin to expose web content to endusers you want a situation where the info that is goin to endusers is not intercepted midway
we hv what is called man in the middle attack , eg  you are working for bank of America , u are the one setting up their env, interms of hw users access their account etc
and they go online and type their account details like user name ,passwd, etc and those info is been transferred over the internet , it has to get to the bank of america 
databases ,so its goin tru what is called hypertext transfer protocol, httpp 
if thats hw the data is been transferred hw do i ensure that the transmission is secured, i need to kinda encrypt that transmission such that once the info is typed (eg passwd)
whoseover is trying to the passwd access the data inbtw  once its been transmitted, he will nt be able to see the passwd info , he will see some deadbrigde bc i hv suceeded
in encrypting the data, and to encrypt data ill use certificate either ssl or tls , so we will look at it as well 

but i can also transfer data via clear text , so u can transferr data tru http or https , https is hypertext transfer protocol secured
this is what is enecrypted from end to end, data is encrypted from end to end , data is encrypted at rest and in transit  and to do that you need certificate to achieve it
which is either ssl certificate secure layer or tls .


****** this is like the  what, the why , the how
why shud that be done, how shud it be done, when should that be done and when should that be done 
so if you have an application mgt process, when should you be bothered abt encryption, at what time ,,, ofcourse when you want to expose appl to client u need data to be
encrypted

Thank you for this interview, my name is James Agu, i am what you will call a devops IT technology nut, i hv been in IT for over 20yrs, i started frm an IT desktop support
and hv risen all the way up to a devops engr and am passionate as what i do as a devops engr, currently i work fro cooks comm and i work for rapid scale and am proud to say
i was part of the teeam that was able to implement cloud formation and we move the team frm onprem to we were are now a fully developed cloud provider.
i hv my masters in IT, and i knw this is hw much of nut case that i am that certifications do not validate who you are bt am also proud to say i have my AWs CERTIFICATION
and i also hv security plus and am just excited abt what i can bring to your coy, i am very excited abt micro services and i read up on your coy and i realise that 
the direction you guys are going is what am passionate about and i cannot wait to bring containerizationa nd microservices and all the years of skills hv been able to 
master across diff platforms to your coy...
once again thank you for this opportunity and i cant wait to see where the future leads

Thank you vrey much my name is .. am a devops engr and hv over 8years of exp in IT and technical compentency in delivering high quality solutions that meets the biz 
requirements of our customers and i manage and provision highly available and fault tolorance infratsructure using terafrm and i automate this process and support & uptimize
deployment by building CI/CD pipelines , i aslo work with developers to support the software development lifecycle and ensuring that we hv quality assurance and audit and the
best practices are followed tru all our processes
i have extensive field experince and domian expertize in deploying,managing, modifying and configuring various applictaions using devops tools such as jenkins, docker,k8,
ansible, git and aws etc and hv successfuly completed several projects with my team, where i also cordinated managing the IT teams, the vendors, stakeholders that are involved
and hv implemented and upgraded several applications am always open to learning new tools and technology and i will like to be an assest to every org i work in , 
i possess strong communication skill ,strong collaboration skill, problem solving skill and troubleshooting skills and am dedicated to delivering cx sactisfaction and the 
team success wherever i am 


39.oo
my name is i have worked as a devops engr for 8yrs now, i actually cm frm a background of project mgt thats scrum, wher am bringing value to my team and org is quite smt
hv got interest in, having trained and worked as a devops engr hv ensured that am proficient in almost all the tools used in automating processes, bearing in mind that 
devops to me is an intersection btw the development and operation scheme to ensure that the deployment of application are done quicker and at a cheaper cost. hence having
used all these tools starting frm versioning tools, scm, other automation tools such as jenkins, maven , even nginx that at some point we use as a webserver or the tool that
enable us reach out to multiple application servers, up to k8 we use as a deplyment and docker as our containerisation tool , so all these tools hv used and applied
bearing in mind that i bring to the org profficiency &ensuring thers optimization in cost, ensuring the org i work for spends measurable less, i also bear in mind performance
ensuring that the tools we use performs well and increases performance in the team , i also ensure that the tools that we use thers a great deal of tolerance in the sense taht 
when u look at the biz Cpc , WHICH IS BUSINESS continuity programme , we can now ensure that tolerance is dealt with , we can now measure literary using a metrix to measure
how much of a down time we can tolerate or not tolorate


PROFF:
Thank you so much evrybody, my name is cec, i hv over 10yrs exp in IT, i began my IT career as a desktop support specialist and frm there i became a system administrator,i
equally got in cloud computing and devops engeering and hv beeen working in devops for over 7yrs now, hv helped multiple clients implement devops processes with the 
intention to be able to automate their end to end appl mgt process and hv been able to achieve this using diff tools including git for versiioning and github for SCM
since the client i work with has basically been managing java based projects , we use jenkins for our CI/cd AUTOMATION AND JENKINS is able to integrate using pluggins to 
extend her functions/ functionality and as such, jenkins is able to integrate with git and github in most of i my project that i do mange and with that whnever developer commit 
a new version of the appl jenkins is able to pull that version and with that jenkins intergrate with maven to do a build also jenkins integrate with sonarqube for code 
quality, nexus artifactory, and this appl is been deployed in diff env , i hv some job which deployment is taking place in tomcat servesr some jboss srever bt most of our 
appl are conatinerized so i basically mg8 federated, enterprise and web applications that are developed using java , thats my experience

once again i have over 8yrs helping org, preparing documentaion and am also part of our onboarding specialist so whenevr we hire a new engr/staff , am the person to help him/her
to be able to understand our env, get on speed , so thats who i am as far as the devops end to end process is concerned and i bliv am goin to be one of the best feat that you
expect as far as this role is concerned.

      - I'm task to install docker and kubernetes in ubuntu servers 
      - I containerised applications by:
         - writing and modifying dockerfiles using best practices
         - use ONLY Official images for base images   
         - Reduce the number of RUN keyword to create light weight images 
           because it add layers to your image and the final image size. 
         - use executable form over shell form for CMD,ENTRYPOINT
           & RUN Instructions for the application process to run as parent 
         - Use alpine images as much as possible   
         - scan images before use  
         - .dockerignore file.

           NetworkPolicy
  f. Troubleshooting kubernetes related problems
     - Node = failed nodes /CPU/mem/ OOM Killed / 
     - pod  = pods pending / slow starting pod / wrong image/imageTag
     -        short lifecycle / not a controllerMger
     - manifest problem:
        POD labels not matching controllerMgers selectors  
        POD labels not matching service selectors
