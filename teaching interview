West secondary 
March 29th

1)Hw will u actively/ proactively  fight against racism and oppression 

I always proactively ensure each student have a copy of the class contract & sign it that way they already have an understanding of the expected behaviours but for contrary 
scenario, i have a one on one conversation with the student to understand what prompted that behaviour , I offer guidance and  correction to try to assist where needed then 
i remind the student of the accepted behaviour based on the contract they signed but if the issue needs to be escalated i always reach out to the parents , involve guidance
counsellor/ principals  to get the issue under control
I also use classroom incentive to encourage positive behaviours



2)HOW DO YOU MAKE THE CLASSROOM INCLUSIVE 
Co-creating the classroom norms and rules and establishing it into a contract  
In the classroom there are pictures of written inscription that says welcome in different languages of various country to make evryone feel welcome so they can feel at ease 
to express themselves and perform their best
Also for some business concept, I get them written in various languages and designs or diagrams to get the attention of each student based on their learning preference 
Also for the seating plan, i take a lot things into consideration like their sight, height learning pattern, easily distracted students ..also preferential seating for 
special needs kids, extra lighting where need ed   as well 

Also considering the needs of special needs student for easy access interms of back and forth monitoring 


3)HOW WILL YOU SHOW INCLUSION FOR THE DIvered classroom

Using individualized instruction 
 I use lot of illustrations and examples to bring in what they can idividually identify with … I use with lots of examples and illustration to make sure the course content
resonant with each one of the students on a personal level.i use examples, Tk for example if i was to teach on the topic money, to show an example of money, i will ensure
that  for every student  in the class theres a cuurency for the students country of origin because that’s something they are familiar with as such they have a better 
understanding of the concept been taught and that applies to every other topic 
But for other topics i use the differnt cultures or items or individuals the student can identify with bases on their origin

Also I take into consideration their different learning styles ,  using repition where necessary, asking questions to ensure they are following 
For classroom activities 
And For students with IEP 
Also I use individualized instructions
I paried them up with other stidents based on their interest & abilities
Provide extra time and assisstamce during the lesson
Provide hints and visual guides as reminders

With learning instruction that was prepared to meet the individual needs of the stidents,it gives students the confidence they nid to grow academically which instills within 
them a growth mindset, play on students multiple imtelligences
Examples include Think-tac-toe, RAFT



4)How do u use assessment for equity for the diversed students

Lessons were taught with individualised instruction so yes its only fair that the assessment is also based on the students level of intelleligence, ensuring the level of
difficulty is within the reach of the student
Also i give extra time 
I use oral questions
Provide hints &visual guide as reminder
All this is to facilitate to student to understand the question better for better performance

I use summative assessment : Using task or an activity to measure record n report on a stidents level of achievement based in regards to specific learning expectations e.g
test rubics

Formative&diagnostic assessment:  using a task or activity to deter students progress during a unit of instruction

Also homework for continous assessment


5)diff teaching strategy
Group discussion
Individual n pair discussion
Think pair/share discussion  
Practice question
Gallery work n power point based on the interests n learning styles of the students

6)WHEN CLASS IS DISTRACTED
Discuss the situation openly n honestly wit all the students
Tell dem their learning is being disrupted nt fair to peers
Changing d structure of d whole class , incorporare grp wrk, technology nt all lecture

7)FOR OVER ACTIVITY

Send student on sch walkabout wit an assistant
Use rocking chair or floor cushions
Tk break and do some stretches / physical movement(DPA)

ANS:
I promote inclusion by ensuring thers room to accomodate everyone base on their individual needs, like their personality, their learning styles, their learning pace etc
In the classroom there are pictures of written inscription that says welcome in different languages of various country to make evryone feel welcome so they can feel at ease
to express themselves and perform their best
Also for some business concept, I get them written in various languages and designs or diagrams to get the attention of each student based on their learning preference 
Also for the seating plan, i take a lot things into consideration like their sight, height learning pattern, easily distracted students ..also preferential seating for 
special needs kids, extra lighting where needed as well 
finally we co-create the classroom norms and rules and then establish it into a classroom contract , that way everyone is aware of the expected behaviour and have an 
understandin to accomodate everyone regardless of individual difference 

FOR HOW ILL CONTRIBUTE
1) ill contribute to the teaching and learning aspect of the school by ensuring use of differentiated and individualized learning instruction to accomodate the different 
learning needs and styles of the students
2)iil contribute to the social aspect of the school by availing myself to contribute to social activities so they colourful and entertaining e.g scheduling rehearsals for 
activities that requirethe student to dance or sing 


2) how do you in your create an inclusive curricular pedagogy ............

ANS:
  the teaching process starts with planning the course content, preparing the instructional material , delivering the lesson and finally evaluation and am also aware of the
new curriculum 
1)so firstly, from preparing the instructional material, a 3part lesson plan ie minds on or set induction, to action and then consolidation, i access the ministry approved doc 
and pull out the overall expectation, i ensure instructionis differentiated and individualized to suit the different needs and learning styles of the students 
2)2ndly, in delivering the lesson ,with the set objectives in mind, i implore different taeching strategies and use a combination of assessments to accomodate the diff 
learners in my class
am using technology extensively ,i use universal learing design ensuring that all the students are learning with the resource materials provided when am done teaching i 
check if the desired outcome was achieved for example by asking questions or if outcome isnt achieved, i hv to roll back with more explanation
assigning exercises from the textbk as homework
3)finally, for evaluation, the students are evaluated based on their knowledge and interest, their thinking ability application and communication


3)explain what you hv done in your current role to improve instructional and assessment practices with an aim of improving the success of black, indigenous and other 
marginalized students ...???

ANS:
coming from a developing country like Nigeria, i have witnessed first hand the detriments of marginalization in education from inadequate learning materials to unconducive
learning environment so first and foremost have been able to contribute to instructional and assessment fo tthe success of black indigenous and marginalized student by
1)creating an active feedback channel , that way at the end of each teaching and learing section the students can reachout for futher clarification and guidance where needed
2)effective evaluation : by this process when am done taeching i check if desired outcome was achieved by asking questions and if not i am able to roll back with further
explanation
3)continous followup on students performance this is implore when the students are not performing as expected, for example i reach out to the parents and guidance when
necessary to have an idea of why the situstion is so, ask quetsions like what they do with at home with their spare time and with that i am able to provide further
assistance
like provide extra lessona, assignment etc



                       

                                                   RICK HANSEN SECONDARY SCHOOL

1) HOW WILL YOU promote anti black racism

ANS:
   i always ensure an inclusive classroom by incorporating group work there by esuring each group potrays inclusiveness of the wide range of diverse races in the classroom
that answer will be be inclusivity question but for anti black racism ill say : by ensuring that each grp potrays inclusiveness of the black community 
also, anytime & anywhere in whatever form or manner i see black racism been potrayed or promoted, i always speak up against it & get the appropriate personnels & authorities involved 
for it to be addressed appropriately.

2) WHICH EXPRIENCE OR LESSON HAS INFORMED YOUR TEACHING PRACTICE
ANS:
ill refer back to when i just started my teaching career, i usually didnt split my lesson into apporpriate units that way the students were usuually bombarded with too much
infomation which made the lesson boring and tiresome but once i was coached by the department head i got to restrategize thereby breaking my lessons into smaller units which
makes it easy for the students to grasp d lesson content bc with smaller units am able to provide more illustrations & examples in which makes d learning process interesting
and successful.

3)PROVIDE ILLUSTRATION OF HOW YOU CONNECT WHATS TAUGHT WITH THE LIVE EXPERIENCES OF THE STUDENTS
ANS:
for example if i was to teach on a topic money or buying and selling , il aks the students hv u been involved in buying and selling before now based on their response 
we connect whats taught in the classroom to their real life experience .... i let them know we may b carrying out the theoritical aspect here but what your doing at the mall
is the practical aspect
also, in the school, i organise sales show of  eg book sales, bake sales, candies etc ,that way they experience first hand what the buying &seling process entails in the
real worl such as purchasing the products they sale at the sales show and making proper account of their sales following accounting best practices
