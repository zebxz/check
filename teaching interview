West secondary 
March 29th

1)Hw will u actively/ proactively  fight against racism and oppression 

I always ensure each student have a copy of the class contract and sign it that way they already have an understanding of the expected behaviours but for contrary scenario, i have a one on one conversation with the student to understand what prompted that behaviour , I offer guidance and  correction to try to assist where needed  then i remind the student of the accepted behaviour based on the contract they signed but if the issue needs to be escalated i always reach out to the parents , involve guidance counsellor/ principals  to get the issue under control
I also use classroom incentive to encourage positive behaviours
But when thers ned for 
Classroom mgt


2)HOW DO YOU MAKE THE CLASSROOM INCLUSIVE 
Co-                                                                                                                         creating the classroom norms and rules and establishing it into a contract  
In the classroom there are pictures of written inscription that says welcome in different languages of various country to make evryone feel welcome so they can feel at ease to express themselves and perform their best
Also for some business concept, I get them written in various languages and designs or diagrams to get the attention of each student based on their learning preference 
Also for the seating plan, i take a lot things into consideration like their sight, height learning pattern, easily distracted students ..also preferential seating for special needs kids, extra lighting where need ed   as well 

Also considering the needs of special needs student for easy access interms of monitoring back and fort


3)HOW WILL YOU SHOW INCLUSION FOR THE DIvered classroom

Using individualized instruction 
 I use lot of illustrations and examples to bring in what they can idividually identify with … I use with lots of examples and illustration to make the course content resonant with each one of the students on a personal level.  I   examplesTk for example if i was to teach on the topic money, to show an example of money, i will ensure that  for every student  in the class theres a cuurency for the students country of origin because that’s something they are familiar with as such they have a better understanding of the concept been taught and that applies to every other topic 
But for other topics i use the differnt cultures or items or individuals the student can identify with bases on their origin
 Also I take into consideration their different learning styles ,  using repition where necessary, asking questions to ensure they are following 
For classroom activities 
And For students with IEP 
Also I use individualized instructions
I paried them up with other stidents based on their interest & abilities
Provide extra time and assisstamce during the lesson
Provide hints and visual guides as reminders

With learning instruction that was prepared to meet the individual needs of the stidents, it gives students the confidence they nid to grow academically and instills within them a growth mindset, play on students multiple imtelligences
Examples include Think-tac-toe, RAFT



4)How do u use assessment for equity for the diversed students

Lessons were taught with individualised instruction so yes its only fair that the assessment is also based on the students level of intelleligence, ensuring the level of difficulty is within the reach of the student
Also i give extra time 
I use oral questions
Provide hints &visual guide as reminder
All this is to facilitate to student to understand the question better for better performance

I use summative assessment : Using task or an activity to measure record n report on a stidents level of achievement based in regards to specific learning expectations e.g test rubics

Formative&diagnostic assessment:  using a task or activity to deter students progress during a unit of instruction

Also homework for continous assessment


5)diff teaching strategy
Group discussion
Individual n pair discussion
Think pair/share discussion  /   Practice question

Gallery work n power point based on the interests n learning styles of the students

6)WHEN CLASS IS DISTRACTED
Discuss s situation openly n honestly wit all rhe students
Tell dem their learning is being disrupted nt fair to peers
Changing d structure of d whole class , incorporare grp wrk, technology nt all lecture

7)FOR OVER ACTIVITY
Provide squeeze balls to stidents
Send student on sch walkabout wit an assistant
Use rocking chair or floor cushions
Tk break and do some stretches / physical movement(DPA)
It was great meeting you as well!You are very welcome!Wonderful, thank you!
